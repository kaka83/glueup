16972,"Success Story: How the ITE Met Section went Paperless with EventBank","This success story is a result of feedback received from the <a href=""https://ite-metsection.org/"">Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Metropolitan Section of New York and New Jersey</a> in the United States where a solution was needed to help run their events in a more streamlined and efficient manner. The ITE Met Section was seeking a solution that would allow them to do less paperwork and retrieve more data so they may understand the success of their events and improve future events.
<h2>Painful Paperwork and Manual Processes</h2>
The ITE Met Section had been using a manual check-in process that required a lot of paperwork prior to signing on with EventBank in October of 2019. Paperwork had to be reported to the national parent-organization, so it was difficult to keep track of event registrations and check-ins while making sure that each person filling it out was doing so properly.

Manual check-in operations are often victim to lost data, confusion, and hassle, all of which can add up to improper data analytics that could have otherwise helped improve future events.

Farukh Ijaz, Secretary of ITE Met Section, saw first-hand that “more paperwork was being done than necessary.” Because of this and his tech enthusiast nature, he knew that there was a better way to approach events. Farukh began to research check-in technology online and came across EventBank where he asked for a demo shortly after realizing how much the software could help with ITE Met Section's events.
<h2>Simplifying and Enhancing Events with EventBank</h2>
After implementing EventBank into its events strategy, ITE Met Section noticed commendable improvements to its check-in process, time saved, and data quality, even with the normal learning curve one might find themselves in when making a drastic change from paper to paperless.

Along with getting rid of time-consuming paperwork, EventBank also has helped the ITE Met Section in other ways. Their previous registration software would simply print out an excel sheet which led to complications on who had paid and who didn’t, duplicate pages, version changes and so on.

With EventBank, all of their registration information is in one place within the cloud-accessed CRM and has made the check-in process run much more smoothly and removes any possibility of having data mishap or duplicate data.

ITE Met Section's pre and post-meeting reports which once took a lot of time to compile are now all within EventBank’s system where they can track it and create easy follow-ups to event attendees. No doubt the ability to use EventBank's drag-and-drop dashboards to create dynamic, customized, and interactive data sets have been a boon to ITE Met Section's data analysis.

Where they had previously been spending hours on paperwork, they are now able to use that time to analyze the data that the EventBank platform provides to look at the broader picture of event success.

<h2>The Results</h2>
When the ITE Met Section sought help for their check-in process, what they found was an EventBank platform that was able to provide them so much more. Not only has EventBank helped them with cutting out time-consuming paperwork, but it has also provided them with a CRM and Email tool that has made things easier.

They previously used multiple other platforms to help manage their events and the two did not work well together. With EventBank, the ITE Met Section now has a powerful all-in-one tool that has helped them take their events to the next level.

There are actually quite a few tools that help you create such a live social wall specifically for events, and so we’ll take a look at a few of the best tools out there on the web. Let’s check out the top 15 social media feed tools for your next event.

<h2 id=""tagboard""><a href=""https://tagboard.com/"">Tagboard</a></h2>
&nbsp;

Tagboard is a platform used to identify certain #Hashtags that are relevant to your event and combine any and all posts on twitter, Instagram, or Facebook into a publicly available wall. This is a form of social media walls that leverages hashtags in popular social media platforms rather than making a standalone wall. Tagboard has the added benefits of allowing you to moderate and curate posts on your wall before they go live as well as creating different templates walls for your preferred look.

<h2 id=""taggbox""><a href=""https://taggbox.com/social-media-wall-events/"">Taggbox</a></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-17104 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Taggbox.png"" alt="""" width=""711"" height=""548"" />

Taggbox is a social media wall like Tagboard, however with a specific focus on large physical screens at display on the event floor. Taggbox allows for curation, advertising, and all that other platforms offer, but with a UI that is enlarged and fit for larger screens. Automatic scrolling, animations, slides, and more allow for attendees to watch the feed scroll in real-time without the need to touch the screen.

<strong>Price:</strong> <span style=""color: #00b832;""><strong>Free</strong></span>
<h2 id=""curationwall""><a href=""https://curationwall.com/"">Curationwall</a></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-17097 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Curation-Wall.jpg"" alt="""" width=""471"" height=""400"" />

Curationwall is a similar platform to Taggbox, where a platform built for in-event screens follows your indicated hashtags and allows for the curation of posts in real-time. The added benefit of Curationwall is the ability to create polls and surveys within the feed so that you can collect results from attendees before, during, and after the event. Curationwall also has a very in-depth analytics backend that aims to help you in creating reports based on user posts statistics and printable survey results.

Juicer is another form of social media wall that uses hashtags once again, but this time relying entirely on a very detailed set of analytics to deliver value. Among this, Juicer also starts free, giving it a very scalable pricing model, making it surprisingly affordable for smaller events.

At EventBank, we combine the best event features into an all-in-one platform from event page creation, email campaigns, registration, and ticketing. One of our value-added services is the social wall feature embedded into the both the desktop and mobile app versions. The difference with EventBank is that since attendees generally have an account with the EventBank app to enter EventBank hosted events, the social wall is completely isolated to the EventBank community using it at the event. No more hashtags, you’ll have a completely self-owned social media wall that can help foster communities for your events, and even more helpful for organizations with members who host a series of events over any given year.

17125,"Success Story: Queens Chamber of Commerce’s Software Upgrade","This success story is a result of feedback from the Queens Chamber of Commerce (Queens Chamber) in New York, United States where a solution was needed to provide a powerful CRM and website, all while being user friendly. The Queens chamber was also looking for a partner that could provide excellent customer service.
<h2>Seeking a Software Upgrade</h2>
The Queens Chamber of Commerce is a very large membership-based organization, so making sure they have software to help manage their members and events effectively is essential. Their previous software, Weblink (now called Memberclicks or Atlas) was not built up to scale with the Queens Chamber perfectly. Although the Queens Chamber had a good relationship with Weblink after working with them for many years, they wanted a software upgrade to help better manage their events and chamber as a whole.

In 2016, a board member of the Queens Chamber of Commerce discovered EventBank and referred it to the organization. They saw a clear value the platform could add to their organization so they signed on with EventBank making them one of the first US chambers to do so. A year later in 2017, they took their contract a step further and designed their website through EventBank’s website design services as well.

EventBank provided the Queens Chamber with a powerful CRM and Events tool-set that shares data between its tools for a more fluid and smarter chamber management experience.
<h2>The Results</h2>
Member Engagement Coordinator of the Queens Chamber, Kevin Collazo explains that “EventBank is user friendly to our members and our staff. It’s also more user friendly on our end when it comes to publishing events, memberships, and the CRM.” EventBank has provided Queens Chamber with an all-in-one solution that is user friendly and has a responsive customer support team.

<blockquote><em>“EventBank has a lot to offer. It has rapidly evolved and adapted to provide a fresh and modern approach to our line of business. The team has been very helpful in addressing our needs. Beyond that, they’re always open to hearing our thoughts and ideas as they strive to improve our day-to-day experience.” </em>
<h6><strong>Kevin Collazo</strong> Membership Engagement Coordinator, Queens Chamber of Commerce</h6>
</blockquote>

Kevin also has a message for other chamber executives who may be using a lackluster software: “Try them out. EventBank is very open to demonstrations and any information needed for EventBank functions and the system overall. They’re also willing to do staff training and have a very good IT support system”

The coronavirus pandemic has left the Queens Chamber working from home to which Kevin Collazo mentions that “we’re able to use and manage our data from anywhere. That has been very helpful as we are all working remotely. We’ve published events, managed our CRM, and financials from home, and that is a big help to our team.”

The Queens Chamber of Commerce has been a customer of EventBank since 2016 and has been happy with the user-friendliness, customer response time, and how the software has grown in its own abilities over the years.

17180,"7 Tips to Managing Your Community Through Digital","Managing Communities, whether professional or casual, can require an insane amount of dedication to keeping together, keeping it growing, and keeping it active. It’s more than just being active and taking charge of the community’s activities, it’s about creating a system where the members feel both welcome and in-control as well. A dead community loses members, a living community grows them, and this is generally the rule-of-thumb for any community manager for quite some time now.

These days we have tools online that can help with your community management by taking it digital, let’s take a look at a few tips we have that can help you digitalize your community management experience so you can manage more members with fewer headaches.

<h2 id=""guidelines"">Create Community Guidelines</h2>
<img class=""alignnone wp-image-15448 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/value-copy-14@2x.png"" alt=""chamber of commerce website"" width=""2400"" height=""1288"" />

They’re called policies at companies, constitutions in government, and rules at school.

Guidelines are a simple but highly important set of implied rules that must be agreed upon in any community that aims to thrive. Guidelines set expectations of actions not just for members, but also for management as well. It keeps you on-track to fostering a fair, decisive, and coordinated community that others can trust in.

These can be as simple as: be respectful to others, don’t share personal or sensitive information, etc. Or it can encompass anything that potentially leaves your organization open to legal penalties like following industry practices for professional communities, reserving the right to ban members, and so on.

The important aspect of community guidelines is that it is generally unchanging, and it sets the precedence for moderation, communication, and any other rule pertaining to your community. When writing community guidelines it’s important to think about every angle of potential member engagement and where certain things can be protected, and those actions that require punishment for the foreseeable future.

A lot of communities have online webinars or seminars for new members that act as orientation modules so that the guidelines can be taught to them more succinctly, and it’s a great way to keep members informed of the guidelines without assuming that they’ve read them on their own.
<h2 id=""networking"">Foster Networking</h2>
<img class=""alignnone wp-image-15938 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/value-copy-50@2x.png"" alt=""automating membership management"" width=""2400"" height=""1288"" />

Guidelines can only dictate the limits of power and precedence in a community, but actively growing a community takes a little more finesse. Members in a community are there to communicate with others, and if you’re not fostering communication and networking, then the community will in all likely fail. Probably very quickly.

Fostering Networking is an important aspect of communities, most especially online where communication barriers are much lower than in-person meetings. An online forum, event, chat group, bulletin board, webinars, and other forms of discussion are great places that once arranged with a certain amount of moderation, can become quite active and in a lot of cases can be the core attraction to a community.

Communities are increasingly looking for ways to keep in touch with each other online rather than just in-person meetings as it gives a level of freedom to engage whenever and wherever the member may be. A discussion can die at the end of an event, but if there’s a way for that discussion to move online, it’s longevity, and therefore it’s value to your community is increased.
<h2 id=""events"">Host Events &amp; Webinars</h2>
<img class=""alignnone wp-image-16882 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/eventbank-blog-COVID@2x.png"" alt=""webinar tips"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Events are a great way to take a singular topic that can drive discussions you want. They’re highly engaging and they can even be a point of ROI for communities looking for more options to fund their growth. As we have seen with the COVID-19 pandemic, webinars are also a growing trend with events.

Creating an event based on a certain topic can help drive discussion and activities that benefit your members, as well as helping your community attract new members. Hosting events is another great way to make your community the voice of your industry or genre, while also helping foster networking as we mentioned before. Events can be as small as an orientation for a few new members to as large as conferences and expos.

Community engagement online and offline are most generally at events, and so it’s important to host and manage your event smarter professionally while bridging the online and offline engagement. This means creating an event website, sending invitation emails, ticketing, analytics, and more.
<h2 id=""news"">Broadcast News</h2>
<img class=""alignnone wp-image-16470 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eventbank-exploration-patterns-1-copy-dfsdsd-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-2@2x-2.png"" alt=""marketing trends in 2020"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Broadcasting news, promoting products and services, sharing content, and other ways of blasting communique to your community members act as a way to keep them in the loop. Keeping members in the loop doesn’t necessarily help attract new members, but rather it’s a way to keep members who were close to forgetting the community exists reminded that the community is still active.

It keeps members in the know for upcoming events, aware of news relevant to them, and it even serves as a great way to deliver promotions that benefit members. A newsletter is a great way to start, as a monthly low-down on everything related to your community, but news broadcasting can be done in a myriad of different creative ways like social media posts, chat group messages, stickied posts in a forum, and more.
<h2 id=""regular"">Be Regular</h2>
<img class=""alignnone wp-image-16809 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/eventbank-blog-mobile@2x.png"" alt=""audience engagement"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

It seems like a no brainer, but a whole month went by without any activities, communication, or any visible sign of change in the community can cause major issues, members to leave, or an entire collapse of a community. Humans are sensory people, and in a world of constant content-white-noise online and in the real world, and members who see a lack of anything relevant in the community will very quickly decide to leave once they take notice.

So, it’s important to be regular. Set a schedule for those activities that can benefit from a schedule like social media posts, blog posts, events, and newsletters. Leave room for any ad-hoc communication, and generally, the community will be in a constant state of activity from the management side, which in turn will impact the activity from members.
<h2 id=""analyze"">Analyze the Data</h2>
<img class=""alignnone wp-image-16138 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/value-copy-60@2x-1.png"" alt=""education"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

At the back-end of things, it’s important to analyze data that you can collect from your community. This can be surveys, or it can be web data, all of it can come together to paint a great image of your community’s trends and activities. A great example of using data to a community’s benefit is with events, where online-to-offline activities can be tracked with the right tools in order to encourage more attendee registrations.

If you have a website that can handle online registrations, and that same system for registrations is used for check-in at the event, sometimes even with a simple QR code scan, then it can be simple to see which promotion method provides the higher number of attendee registrations. Small indications like these within the data can help to make decisions like which channel should get a marketing budget, what content members like best, and so on.

To do this requires a range of tools than once integrated together, can provide the necessary data. Some data can be stand-alone and still plenty helpful, like how the performance of email campaigns are based on small changes between 2 of the same type, called A/B tests. Testing if one title works better than another, all other things staying the same, one can know which title worked best in a given campaign.

17204,"8 Strategies that Help Grow Your Professional Community","Growing a professional or industry community is a task that takes some light touches here and big ideas there. Members want to be active even if they’re not, and keeping them active is the key that helps gain new members, produce great events, and of course, grow revenue in the long term.

Engagement is the keyword for most community growth strategies so take some notes and try a few of these strategies at your own community.

<h2 id=""audience"">Identify Your Audience</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16661 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/value-copy-20@2x.png"" alt=""chamber of commerce myths and misconceptions"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Identify your target audience so you’re not wasting resources for recruiting professionals who have no interest in joining your community. You can see this process as a funnel, where you filter out broader industries, then filter our unrelated disciplines, then experience levels, and so on.

You can do this very easily by using LinkedIn’s filtering process, or other professional networking social media sites, and drill down your ideal member by title, experience level, past companies, and so on.

Contrary to logical thinking, you might expect a larger audience to supply a larger amount of members, but in reality, it could cause a waste of promotional resources if a majority of that audience has no interest in your community. So, it's better to start with a narrow audience first and then expand as you learn more about the audience.

For example, a welder’s association may intend to have members who are inexperienced so that they can offer them courses by the association so expand their skills out of mig-welding and into industrial welding. So the audience will need to remove any and all construction titles not related to welding, identify lower-experience workers, and identify those with specifically mig-welding experience who could potentially move into industrial skillsets.

An audience like this would be inevitably quite small, but at the end of the day, the promotional material will be matched quite well and you’ll find yourself getting their attention a lot better than if you just blasted your promotion to those who are already industrial welders.
<h2 id=""induction"">Host Public Induction Meetings</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16091 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/value-copy-57@2x.png"" alt=""communities"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Induction meetings are important for new members to feel welcome and it’s a great way to orientate them with the organization. However doing this privately, a preferred method of a lot of chambers of commerce and associations, may actually be harmful to growth.

Very likely new members would like to invite others to watch the induction meetings, and by keeping the meeting open to the public, it could potentially entice those who may not have even heard of the organization before to join as well if it piques their interest.

Take photos of induction meetings and post them on social media, it helps show the community growth in a very real manner and it exposes the inner workings more to online audiences who might have an interest in joining as well.
<h2 id=""home"">Create a Digital Home</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16951 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/eventbank-webinars@2x.png"" alt=""digital meeting"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

A ‘digital home’ for the community might scream “website” to you, but digital engagement is far past this singular point of online activity. Your community’s digital home has to stretch into social media, forums, chat apps, and more.

Keeping things digital should be quite clear in its value, but in a nutshell, it’s a great way to keep members engaged without having to meet in person. This is most extensively clear during the COVID-19 pandemic which has led to many thousands of businesses and organizations to take their communication entirely 100% online only.

Starting with a website, your digital home base for members should also be with engagement on social media, keep it updated with organization news and you’re sure to drive discussion. It’s also a great place to ask questions, answer questions,
<h2 id=""content"">Create Engaging Content</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16516 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eventbank-exploration-patterns-1-copy-dfsdsd-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-3@2x.png"" alt=""chambers and associations"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Creating engaging content through social media posts, videos, blog posts, white papers, media, or any other digital means is the perfect way to keep the community in the loop and active. At the very least you’re able to keep your community well informed and noticing that the community isn’t dead and maintains the community’s self-involvement.

Keeping the community up to date is good, but keeping them engaged is much more preferable though. So it’s important to make sure your content is engaging and thought-provoking. Surveys on social media, for instance, can give some helpful feedback quickly, or maybe a blog post that explores a rumor among the community and spurs discussion.

Engagement keeps community members from getting bored and forgetting about the community, and generally, it makes them happy to be engaged. In fact, the best definition of “community engagement” is “member happiness”. So make sure when you create content for your community, you ask yourself “would this make me happy to be engaged in?”.
<h2 id=""events"">Host Events Regularly</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16882 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/eventbank-blog-COVID@2x.png"" alt=""webinar tips"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Hosting regular events is another key type of content that deserves its own strategy. Events are a phenomenal way of forcing people to engage. It’s a bit harsh-sounding, but at an event, socializing can oftentimes lead to a lot of professional networking outcomes that are most usually quite positive. It’s your way of forcing those who attend to engage with each other so that more ideas and topics can come up.

Hosting regular events is just like posting regular topics, and in doing so you deliver a sense of organization and real-world value that’s not found on a screen or mobile device. Although, the recent COVID-19 situation has proven that online events are valuable in other situations like long-distance members and so on.

The regularity also can deliver a feeling of consistency, though it’s smart not to rehash old events and to use different event formulas to keep things shaken up. Events are also a great way to ask your most staunchly engaged members to help volunteer or even speak at the event, reducing headaches in headhunting speakers yourself.
<h2 id=""keymembers"">Identify Key Members</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16137 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/value-copy-58@2x.png"" alt=""key members"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

It’s important to identify key members of your community and engage them into action that gains even more members. These hyper-engaged community members are likely one of your strongest allies to growth for any professional organization, and some considerations could be made to make use of their engagement for everyone’s benefit.

As we said earlier, events also can benefit from an engaged member being asked to speak or moderate at events. It’s someone who likely understands the audience and very likely willing to do anything you ask of them.

In some industries, even highly engaged members have been asked to join the organization full time as staff as a reward for their high engagement and work towards bettering the community at large. It’s also a great chance to ask these highly engaged members to share news and promote the community as well.
<h2 id=""small"">Support Smaller Organizations</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16527 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eventbank-exploration-patterns-1-copy-dfsdsd-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-5@2x.png"" alt=""event management skills"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

It’s also important to support smaller and tertiary organizations that are related to your professional community. It’s a strategy that makes your community look like the voice of the industry and other professionals may look to your community first for news, topics, trends, and more.

Smaller organizations are also helpful in introducing tertiary industries to your community for a sort of synergy between related fields. By helping smaller organizations grow, your community can find other benefits in public relations as well as attracting new members.
<h2 id=""communication"">Monitor Communication</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-17119 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/eventbank-social-wall-blog@2x-1.png"" alt=""community wall"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

At the end of the day, monitoring the communication and discussion of your community is extremely important for you to understand what needs to be done to avoid problems or upcoming trends that can turn into topics of discussion or even events centered on trends.

This is where having a digital home becomes important. Having a digital home doesn’t just mean a place where they can communicate, but to communicate freely (within the bounds of your community guidelines of course.). There could even be opportunities for key members to provide real values to your community through being speakers or moderators at events or volunteering to take on responsibilities for the organization.

If you want to grow your professional community, it's important to know what they're interested in, what events they enjoy, and what content they love. It can be tough to track these data points when you're growing, so it's important to use a CRM of registered users on your platform, an email marketing platform for communication, and ticketing and management for your events.

When was the last time you put on a suit? Or a dress? Or even pants?

Like everyone around the globe, the past few months have changed our lives and our work environment, maybe forever. No water cooler conversations about the latest office gossip, no happy hours with co-workers at the watering hole next door, and no industry conferences or seminars to attend and meet like-minded individuals. We are learning a whole new way of doing things, not just how to ""Zoom"".

For EventBank, as we have been building the best membership and event management cloud software over the last seven years, we have learned that it is so important for professionals to participate in ""communities"" and events to continue building their business or their career. Our mission has always been to ""to transform the way professional communities enable and enrich relationships"" and it is our belief that these relationships are what is going to help propel the world out of this crisis.

Before, many professional communities were defined based on ""when is the next event?"" - whether it was a conference, seminar, networking event, expo, etc. Now, we must ensure that these communities exist all the time, even from our homes.

Over the past three months, since Covid-19 hit our Asia-Pacific operations and then our five other global offices, including here in the U.S., we have worked non-stop to come up with better technology for our clients to engage with their communities online. Today, after many sleepless nights, we are pleased to launch...

17254,"EventBank Launches Community Product to Help Clients Better Engage During the Crisis","Tysons, Virginia- Today, <a href=""http://www.eventbank.com"">EventBank</a>, a cloud-based membership and event management SaaS company, launched their new community product to help chambers and associations better engage their professional communities online. The release includes a new webinar engagement solution, digital business cards, and direct-messaging system. The community updates are in response to the COVID-19 crisis where associations, chambers, and event planners are challenged with keeping their members and attendees connected in a digital world. These new features are a way for industry professionals to provide value for their markets in troubling times.

Associations, chambers of commerce, and the event industry have been hit extremely hard with the COVID-19 crisis, significantly impacting their revenue that was primarily driven through in-person events. Founded in 2013, EventBank’s new community product gives clients a new way to provide their community with a digital place where they can share their ideas, discuss industry news and best practices, and sell their products or services even when meeting in person is not an option. In difficult times, it is imperative that members of a community come together to help one another and this new community product gives the perfect place to make this happen.

Online networking is now crucial for sustained community growth. That’s why EventBank is also releasing its Digital Business Card and Meeting Request features. Through these new features, organizations can enable their communities to create and share their own digital business cards, manage their contacts, and effectively network with everyone from their homes. The direct messaging feature enables everyone in a community to develop lasting relationships with each other via 1-on-1 chats with the option to share photos, emojis, and more.

While in-person events aren’t possible, everyone is turning to webinars and online events to keep their community informed and connected. EventBank is also launching its premium “webinar engagement solution” where clients can run webinars and online events directly from the password-protected EventBank’s interface. Clients can get a full event experience for their community by combining the existing EventBank event management platform with new digital tools like digital business cards and direct messaging with a new easy plug &amp; play Zoom integration that can be set up in a few clicks.

Regarding the new release, EventBank’s CEO and co-founder Eric Schmidt said “we have worked with associations, chamber of commerce, marketing and events professionals for many years and we realize how much they are struggling to keep things afloat right now. We want to provide our clients with a product that can facilitate growth and engagement in this increasingly digital world. Our new community and webinar updates give our clients the tools to turn this crisis into an opportunity for growth.”

Communities across the country and globe are struggling. EventBank realizes this and wants to help. Through EventBank’s new community features, communities can connect, share, and engage with each other in ways they never could before. While organizations across the world may not be able to host in-person events right now, they can still provide value to their communities in other ways. Keeping them connected and engaged through EventBank’s new community features is certainly a great way to do so.

17298,"How to Network While Attending a Webinar","The new work-at-home trends spurred by COVID-19 has placed events entirely online as webinars, and it’s quickly become a more readily apparent investment by companies and organizations to replace in-person events. What’s severely lacking in a lot of webinars however is the ability to allow attendees to network with one another.
<h2>The Issue with Webinars</h2>
Let’s face it, a good reason a lot of people enjoy attending events aside from the content, is the chance to meet everyone at the events, network, exchange business cards, and even potentially sell to target attendees later on.

You can’t do that in a webinar.

Most platforms don’t have a feature at all to even send direct messages to attendees, see their contact info or any other way to expand your contact database. You can’t even just open the webinar to networking either because then you’ll have everyone talking over each other at once, even for a small 20 person event, it’s impossible to network in one single call.

Most platforms are a simple speaker-to-audience method that offers very little in terms of digital mingling, however, this was mostly due in part to webinars being mostly secondary to a lot of events. These days however, with a now almost completely work-from-home business world, platforms are updating and new webinar products are launching to help support networking during webinars.

Here’s a few tips to help you network during webinars.
<h3>Quick Reads</h3>

<h2 id=""cards"">Exchange Digital Business Cards</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16372 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/saveyourchamber-5@2x.png"" alt=""digital membership cards"" width=""1406"" height=""1138"" />

Digital business cards a new trend that’s being developed on a few platforms that host webinars in an attempt to allow attendees to take time before, during, and after the webinar to network. It works like this:

You set up and edit your own personal business card virtually within the platform, no one can see it but you. <i>Unless </i>you opt to share it with another attendee on the call, at which point they could accept it, saving it to their profile, and then they could then share back their own card to you, or not. Just like in real life.

Some platforms allow you to send messages along with the card share as not to disturb the webinar taking place, others allow a limited number of share per webinars, and so on, so choose the right platform for your networking needs.
<h2 id=""walls"">Use Social Walls</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-17115 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/eventbank-social-wall.png"" alt=""social wall for events and webinars"" width=""1200"" height=""600"" />

Live Walls, Social Walls, Event Feed, you name it, it’s a social media-like place for attendees to share their experiences, photos, ideas, and more. You can find this feature on some standalone integrations for webinar products, and sometimes as included features, but they’re generally the same.

A social wall allows you to not only see who else is in the webinar, but it’s a great way to vet which attendees are most engaged with it. It’s not a rule but if you catch someone posting a lot on the wall, then it might be a good place to start making friends. Make sure you also post in the wall and get some recognition, it’s a great way to let others come network to you as well.

If it’s not available for others to directly find your contact info in the platform of choice for their webinar’s social well, try to end your posts with a twitter name, email, or phone number so others can contact you.
<h2 id=""message"">Direct-Message Other Attendees</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-17232 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/def6d15d-530c-49bc-9cd2-49b6ea167476.png"" alt=""direct messaging for webinars and events"" width=""600"" height=""461"" />

Another growing trend among webinars is hosting the event on platforms that allow for direct messaging of other attendees. Direct messaging is a fairly straightforward and direct approach to networking. You find the name of the attendee, and you message them.

Easy right?

It really is that easy, but take some advice from us, use some context when you message someone at an event, direct messaging has a connotation of being very personal, and being too upfront can easily turn someone off from talking to you if you butt into their experience too bluntly. Try to bring up context from the webinar that engages them.
<h2 id=""livechat"">Leverage the Live Chat</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-17228 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1a0942ac-be23-4e1d-b5ed-59541ee9d66d.png"" alt=""webinar live chat "" width=""600"" height=""500"" />

The most common form of communication during a webinar is the live chat that happens during the event. Use this chance to engage with the speaker of course, and be active. It’ll get more eyes on you, and to make it easier to reach you, try to keep your contact info of your choice on your clipboard so you can paste it at the end of each message so no one can miss out on an opportunity to keep in touch with you after the webinar.

Another great thing about live chat is it helps you scalp the audience for the most engaged individuals, so keep an eye out for those who are most engaged to target, almost like our advice for social walls.
<h2 id=""social"">Reach Out on Social Media</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-17237 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8-strategies-community@2x.png"" alt=""social connections eventbank"" width=""2400"" height=""1288"" />

Discover what social media or twitter hashtags are being used by the event host, it’ll help you engage with other attendees outside of the event. Start by posting a big thank-you type post, or any other engaging idea you’d like to share about your experience, and be sure to include the relevant hashtags.

Even better, tag the speakers and notable attendees in your post, it’ll signal them on social media platforms that they’ve been mentioned and they’ll have a higher chance of re-sharing or direct messaging you. You might even spur a conversation that’s public, and drives more people to reach out.

Social media is a good place to direct message other attendees you saw in the webinar, just remember our advice for direct messaging, and it should go quite well.
<h2>Back to You</h2>
There are newer trends and permissions being granted to webinars these days that make them more acceptable to network on, and it’s important to dig around any webinar you might attend to see how you can best make sure of what’s available to network with other attendees.

At EventBank we make sure that we do all of the above for our clients so they can not only throw some great webinars out there, but also deliver an almost in-person event-like experience to their attendees as well with included business card exchange, social walls, direct messaging, and more. <a href=""https://get.eventbank.com/""><b>Book a demo </b></a>with us today and we’ll show you how it works.

The effects of the recent COVID-19 pandemic has shown many businesses across the world who previously skirted webinars as a strategy that webinars are in fact highly engaging, effective, and accessible. But before anyone can just launch a webinar, it starts with some good webinar invite emails, follow-up emails, and other strategies that help promote any online event.

Sometimes people can be just plain old busy. A long-form email may not swing well with them, and for that reason, a short and sweet email might do the trick. What do we mean short and sweet? Just tell them in one sentence what the webinar is all about and all the pertinent details like the date, time, link for registration. Don’t even worry about naming speakers, or showing the agenda. All this can be linked to a page on your event registration page. The goal here is to make it so that at a single glance the recipient can get the big picture of the event topic and get their registration on impulse.

<b>Best for:</b>
Short webinars less than one hour
Single-speaker webinars
Webinars with a low number of moving pieces

On the flip side, if your audience is a detail-oriented type, a long-form email with all webinar info may be needed to sway them into registering. This is a simple type of email because what you’re basically doing is listing out all the webinar’s details, from its full description, agenda, speaker list, everything.

This doesn’t mean to just dump everything into an email and hope for the best, remember to list everything in order of most important to least important, and then throw in some design-friendly images and formatting so it’s easy to read.

<b>Best for: </b>
Long webinars more than one hour
Multi-speaker webinars
Multi-day webinars
Complex subject matter

<h2 id=""animated"">3. Animated</h2>
[caption id=""attachment_17321"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""600""]<img class=""wp-image-17321 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/animated.gif"" alt=""animated email invite for webinars"" width=""600"" height=""1080"" /> Image by Adweek[/caption]

A little marketing prowess to use in your webinar email invites can be the use of animated images, also known as .gif files. They’re animated images without sound, and without the need to use a media player.

Psychological studies have shown that moving images are more engaging for people to devote their attention to than a still image, generally speaking. However a funny little .gif may be engaging, but it would be even better to find or make a .gif that helps emphasize the webinar’s value.

Some tips for animations to make sure they pass the engagement test is to make sure they’re short from beginning-to-end, at most ten seconds, and make sure that it loops as cleanly as possible so it’s not off-putting. Don’t forget to actually add all the pertinent information of the webinar as well to the EDM as explained above, but usually, animated images work in a lot of formats.

<h2 id=""video"">4. Video</h2>
[caption id=""attachment_17343"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""560""]<img class=""wp-image-17343 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/video-edm.jpg"" alt=""video edm for webinar invites"" width=""560"" height=""797"" /> Image by Unbounce[/caption]

Video email invites for webinars are another handy addition to help engage recipients, but it’s important to have a plan for it. Remember that a lot of email clients that users have may or may not support embedded videos in emails going to their inbox, so the usability of this can be a little particular.

The strategy itself is usually successful, and it’s merely an extrapolation of the animated image idea, just with the added ability to have a more lengthy video with audio now. This is a great way to explain the value of the webinar, and some examples could be having the speaker give a brief 2-minute spiel to the camera explaining what they’re about to talk about so it hooks in viewers who want to see the rest of what they have to say in the webinar itself.

<b>Want a tip?</b>
You can sometimes bypass this by having the video hosted elsewhere, preferably your website or event site, and take a screenshot thumbnail from the video and place an image of a play button on the screenshot and then place a hyperlink on the image when you place it in your email. When recipients click on the image, thinking it’s an embedded video, it’ll link them to the website where the video actually exists. This should get the viewership of the video up.

<h2 id=""question"">5. Pose a question</h2>
[caption id=""attachment_17324"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""614""]<img class=""wp-image-17324 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pose-question.png"" alt=""webinar question email invite example"" width=""614"" height=""734"" /> Image by Oracle[/caption]

If your webinar is going to reveal some industry secrets, discoveries, or anything else unheard of before to your audience, then it could be profitable to pose a question in your email invite that hooks your audience into wanting to find the answer to that’s locked in the webinar. This question-posing email type is great when your company has something that no other webinar has, maybe it’s an industry statistic, a strategy that no one has tried before, a discovery, or other cool exclusive information.

<h2 id=""seats"">6. Call them “seats”</h2>
[caption id=""attachment_17325"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""567""]<img class=""wp-image-17325 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Seats.png"" alt=""email invite seats"" width=""567"" height=""289"" /> Image by Rejoiner[/caption]

A simple psychological trick is to call registering or ticket-reservations specifically for webinars is to actually refer to them as “seats”. This gives readers the idea that there may be a limited quantity of reservations when in general most webinars can have an endless amount. It’s simple, but an effective trick to use on readers to gain some impulse registrations.

<a href=""#top"">Back to Top.</a>
<h2 id=""calendar"">7. Send a Calendar of Webinars</h2>
[caption id=""attachment_17322"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""433""]<img class=""wp-image-17322 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Calendar-of-Webinars.jpg"" alt=""calendar of webinars"" width=""433"" height=""1080"" /> Image by Zoom[/caption]

This is more of an additive to any email invite for a specific webinar that shows a list or calendar of upcoming webinars should the webinar in-question in the email not be their cup of tea. It’s a great way to spill over uninterested recipients into other future events so they’re both satisfied and not wasted on an email just junking it in their inbox.

<a href=""#top"">Back to Top.</a>
<h2 id=""agenda"">8. Send the Whole Agenda</h2>
[caption id=""attachment_17323"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""680""]<img class=""wp-image-17323 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Long-Form.png"" alt=""agenda for webinar email"" width=""680"" height=""2890"" /> Image by Fender[/caption]

If you’re running a wide range of smaller webinars as part of a series, or a multi-day webinar event, try sending a hyper-detailed agenda in your email invite. Unlike a long-form email, use the agenda as a major point of information in the email, where each session in the agenda has its own little blurb, speaker profiles, time slot, or even it’s own registration within the event itself. This is a neat little way to compartmentalize a large event so that it’s easier to digest for recipients who don’t have time to review the event as a whole.

<b>Best for: </b>
Large multi-track webinars

<a href=""#top"">Back to Top.</a>
<h2 id=""confirmation"">9. Include a Confirmation Email</h2>
[caption id=""attachment_17342"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""860""]<img class=""wp-image-17342 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ConfirmationEmailsForEventsWithExamples_Image4.jpg"" alt=""confirmation email for webinar invite "" width=""860"" height=""1080"" /> Image by Exact Target[/caption]

If it’s not included in your webinar registration system of choice, you should create a sequence in any email marketing software of your choice where any registered contacts get dumped into a register-confirmed list. Once they enter this list, it sends them a confirmation email automatically which is ideal for making recipients feel that they’ve completed registration completely.

An extra goodie to send along is re-confirmation of the event’s time, date, and link, but also include a nice “add to calendar” link which should come native to a lot of email inboxes so that they can mark the event on their calendar. Alternatively, the confirmation email will send an invite to their email’s calendar so they can accept and have it marked on their calendar automatically.

<a href=""#top"">Back to Top.</a>
<h2 id=""speakers"">10. Introduce the Speaker(s)</h2>
[caption id=""attachment_17327"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""680""]<img class=""wp-image-17327 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Speaker-highlight.png"" alt=""speaker highlight email invite for webinars"" width=""680"" height=""1128"" /> Image by Asana[/caption]

If the speaker is the star of the party, or otherwise you have some speakers with notoriety, it may be prudent to actually focus the webinar email invite content on the speaker(s) themselves at the same level as the event or even more so. Sometimes this can be an event that’s solely about the speaker as the topic, and so it easily becomes its own topic. Don’t let this dissuade you from promoting speakers in multi-speaker webinars either though, as anyone in your audience might find them intriguing enough to want to listen to.

<a href=""#top"">Back to Top.</a>
<h2 id=""deck"">11. Deliver the Deck First</h2>
In some cases, persuading the most dubious of recipients could take some exchange of harder-content. In most webinars, speakers will talk alongside a deck that’s being screen-shared, and if there’s no policy about sharing the deck, then try to link the deck as a downloadable PDF to the email invite. By offering your hand with a file that has a lot of great content in it, it might be just enough to encourage a registration.

It’s important that this works with Decks that have some cool information, but <b>not all the information.</b> If you were to deliver a full deck with all the main points and takeaways from the webinar, then likely they’ll just keep the deck and won’t register.

<a href=""#top"">Back to Top.</a>
<h2 id=""reminder"">12. Last-Minute Reminder</h2>
This one is obvious but a lot of webinar hosts can sometimes rely too much on a reminder being set by the recipient on their preferred digital calendar. It’s important to send a content-packed reminder email to recipients about the webinar they signed up for a day or an hour before it starts. The content helps remind them what the webinar is about, or entirely to remind them that they signed up for the webinar so they don’t miss it.

<a href=""#top"">Back to Top.</a>
<h2 id=""recording"">13. Share a Recording</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-17328 size-medium"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/webinar-replay-256x204.png"" alt=""webinar replay email"" width=""256"" height=""204"" />

Share a recording of a related past webinar, maybe it’s part 1 of the now upcoming part 2 in a webinar series. This is a fantastic way to entice those who didn’t attend previous webinars into catching up so they can attend part 2 live.

<a href=""#top"">Back to Top.</a>
<h2 id=""highlights"">14. Share a Highlights Clip</h2>
If you want to pump them up instead of catching them up with a full recording, try to edit a highlights clip of the webinar in a quick 5 min recap of what they missed. It’ll help with conversions a bit more, but also it can act as a great piece to share on social media.

<a href=""#top"">Back to Top.</a>
<h2 id=""thankyou"">15. Send a Thank-you</h2>
Simply put, share a thank-you email with your audience who attended...and another version to those who didn’t. Less of a thank-you, and more of a “too bad you missed it, but...” type of email, the thank-you email you send to those who didn’t attend the webinar should highlight the take-aways, deliver the deck, a calendar of future webinars, or anything else they may have missed. Why? Because even if they didn’t attend the event, they could still walk away with value from the event that could convert them into customers in the future. It’s a great way to re-engage those who didn’t attend or didn’t want to attend, and potentially show them something they missed that might convince them to join a future webinar.

17373,"14 Strategies for Paid Webinars that Bring Value","Webinars are online seminars that can be accessed by a seemingly unlimited amount of people from different locations of the world for one single event. Ever since the COVID-19 crisis, there has been an uptick in the number of webinars hosted by different organizations to maintain engagement since physical seminars can no longer be hosted.

In physical seminars, audience members often are required to purchase a ticket to attend. Webinars, in the past, have a hard time selling tickets for audience members due to link sharing. However, using the tips highlighted below, you will be able to run your own successful paid webinar.
<h3 id=""top"">Quick Reads</h3>

<h2 id=""tickets"">Manage Ticket Sales</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16810 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/eventbank-blog-phone@2x.png"" alt=""mobile notifications"" width=""2400"" height=""1288"" />

Managing your ticket sales over webinars will not be an easy task. Ensuring that there are no so-called ‘“Zoom Bombers” creating a ruckus during your webinars is an important consideration to make. While managing your ticket sales you need to verify that your pricing is correct so that potential audience members will be willing to pay for your webinars, and to shield your platform from non-paying audience members or “Zoom Bombers” joining your webinar to ruin your audience member’s experiences.
<h3>1. Charging for your Webinars</h3>
Charging for Webinars can seem like a highly intuitive process but it may not be as easy as you thought. Many web-based Webinar events may not have a front door like a physical venue may have. The sharing of links can hinder your implementation of tickets and exclusivity, and oftentimes, exclusivity alone is valuable enough to charge for tickets.

However, now there are platforms that require accounts for audience members to log into before they can get their exclusive link. Unlike previous problems with link sharing, each link in these platforms allows only the people registered, who paid for a ticket, to access their individual link. Each individual link will only allow one person to join the webinar at a time, which dissuades link sharing, and encourages everyone planning to attend the event pay for their own ticket.
<h3>2. Price Considerations</h3>
Pricing your webinar is a very important aspect of running a paid webinar. In order for potential audience members to purchase a ticket to your paid webinar, their perceived value of your webinar needs to be greater than the price that you are seeking for a ticket. A webinar that is too expensive can dissuade potential audience members from participating in the webinar, however, a webinar that is priced too cheap can lower the perceived value of your webinar. Ensure that your pricing point increases the perceived value of your webinar, while not so high as to dissuade people from joining.
<h2 id=""content"">Create Engaging Content</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16516 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eventbank-exploration-patterns-1-copy-dfsdsd-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-3@2x.png"" alt=""chambers and associations"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Increasing your perceived value by your audience members is an integral part of running a paid webinar. The higher the perceived value for your webinar, the more willing people will be willing to pay for a ticket. In addition to that, the higher the perceived value also equates to the possibility of you charging more for your webinar which can greatly increase revenue. In some instances, the host herself/himself can create can increase the perceived value by following these tips.
<h3>3. Having an Agenda</h3>
If the speaker has an Agenda, it can be posted and marketed before the event to increase the perceived value of your webinar. An agenda conveys to your potential audience members that the speaker is prepared and knows what he will talk about. This increases the perceived value by divulging to potential audience members that the webinar has been prepared and has a game plan.

Moreover, having a game plan allows the speaker to potentially display the agenda on the screen while he is presenting. This increases the perceived value of the webinar because people like to have a road map to see where they are going. Being kept in the blind can trigger thoughts of confusion and trepidation on what would come next. Having an agenda can people follow along easier and focus on the most important topics that they wanted to focus on during the webinar.
<h3>4. Stay on schedule</h3>
Always assume your audience members may have commitments before or after your webinars. Ensure that you start your webinars on time and also end them within the allotted time slot you have promoted. This ensures that audience members no longer need to leave your webinars early, in addition, it shows that you value your audience members' time which will increase the perceived value of your webinar.
<h3>5. Timing</h3>
The timing of your webinar can impact the value that your webinar brings to your audience. If your webinar is hosted during a time that your audience members are able to attend without canceling anything else in their schedule, the perceived value of your webinar will increase. Audience members will not pay for a webinar that is during a time they cannot attend. However, statistically speaking, most people join webinars between the 11am to 2pm time slots in the middle of the workweek, which is where the peak of the perceived value for your webinar could be.
<h3>6. Trained Presenters</h3>
If audience members are paying for your webinar, they expect a high level of professionalism and presenters that are at a high caliber on not only presenting but also with the platform that they are presenting on. This ensures that they are familiar with the software and are apt at dealing with frequently encountered issues swiftly while still presenting. This ensures a smooth transition between technical issues and the webinar. Any technical problems that are not solved swiftly can decrease the perceived value of your webinar. This could lead to a decrease in recurring, paying customers.
<h2 id=""platform"">Leverage an Engaging Platform</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16882 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/eventbank-blog-COVID@2x.png"" alt=""webinar tips"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Not only can the host increase the perceived value of your webinar. There are also strategies that can be implemented on the platform you choose to run your webinars on that can increase your perceived value. Unlike the host created perceived value, the platform created perceived value can be implemented once and does not need to be disturbed aside from the occasional updates. This one-time implementation streamlines the process of implementing techniques to increase perceived value.
<h3>7. Document Sharing</h3>
Implementing document sharing on your platform creates a value that may not be seen on other platforms. Audience members may want to review the slides after the webinar to study the information that your webinar shared. A document sharing implementation for the audience would be a very beneficial application, especially if the document sharing implementation allows the audience member to pick the format they would like to download the slide deck in. This beneficial aspect of document sharing will raise the perceived value of your Webinar which increases the likelihood of a potential audience member paying for a ticket.
<h3>8. Networking</h3>
People who join a webinar tend to be working in the same industry or interested in similar topics. To create more value for your audience members when joining your webinar you should integrate a process for them to able to <a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/webinar-networking/"">network </a>with each other. If audience members were able to design and send virtual business cards to each other, they would be gaining a lot more value from your webinar. This can attract a new segment of audience members who join your webinar with people who have the same interests or work in the same industry as people who commonly join your webinar. This helps the audience member simultaneously learn about the topic of interest as well as network with people from the same industry. This increases the value of your webinar and creates an additional desire for potential audience members to join your webinar.
<h3>9. Q &amp; A Session</h3>
Not every topic that is covered by your webinar will be fully understood by your audience members. In order to give them the greatest value for the webinar that they paid for, including a Q &amp; A session at the end of your webinar for your audience members to ask questions. When audience members are permitted to clarify their questions, they would be leaving the webinar with a much more satisfying disposition and will further understand the value your webinar brings and pay for the next webinar you host.
<h2 id=""technology"">Check Your Tech</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-17196 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tips-communities-going-digital.png"" alt=""webinar technology"" width=""1200"" height=""644"" />

In webinars, technology is the bridge between the gap between your audience members and you, without it you could not connect with your audience members from all around the world. The main technological concerns that should be established are a tested platform that has minimal bugs and the accessibility for all different devices to eliminate exclusivity from potential audience members using specific devices.
<h3>10. Extensively Tested Platform</h3>
When hosting a webinar, many technological factors are at play. With so many technological factors at play, it is important that none of them go wrong during your webinar. Sometimes technological issues that happen can be out of your control, but regardless it conveys a sense of unprofessionalism. Ensure the platform that you are utilizing has been tested and as many bugs as possible are eliminated prior to hosting your webinar.
<h3>11. Mobile Device Friendly</h3>
25% of people sign into webinars from a mobile device, and to include this population of audience members into your webinar audience, implement mobile device compatibility into your webinar. This does not exclude certain members of your audience who plan to sign in on a mobile device. Verifying that your platform can be used with a mobile device increases the number of potential audience members that can purchase tickets and join your webinar.
<h2 id=""audience"">Target Your Audience</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16951 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/eventbank-webinars@2x.png"" alt=""digital meeting"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

To host the paid webinar with audience members joining it, you must inform the target audience about your webinar. You can’t host a webinar with audience members without them knowing about your event. Good marketing and promotions inform the number of people who know about your webinar and convince them to pay and join your webinar.
<h3>12. Targeted Marketing</h3>
Marketing is an integral part of potential audience members learning about your webinar. For you to market it well, ensure you do market research on what platforms that your target audience members frequent. Marketing on those platforms will bring you a larger number of audience members willing to pay for your webinar compared to marketing on a platform where the users are disinterested or unwilling to pay for your webinar.

An important component of target marketing is the visual branding of the marketing materials you publish. The visual brand is the first touchpoint you will have with your potential audience members which could get them interested or ignore your event entirely. A strong visual brand that speaks to your target audience piques their interest and develops preliminary trust for you. Piquing their interest is the first step that ultimately converts them into audience members who will pay for your webinar.
<h3>13. Reminders</h3>
Reminders create value by spreading information to either previous audience members, in one of your previous webinars, about a future webinar you are hosting or reminding people about promotions that are limited by the number of tickets or date of purchase. Reminders can be sent to everyone in your network in an effort to spread the word regarding your webinar, and it could increase the number of registrations for your events. Reminders re-inform your potential audience members about your webinar to increase the amount of paying customers joining.
<h3>14. Promotions</h3>
Promotions are a beneficial way to have more people pay for your webinars. 64% of consumers tend to wait for things to go on sale before purchasing them, so when a promotion is present, potential audience members will be more easily convinced to purchase a ticket to your webinar.

Promotions can include a one-time payment of a certain number of your webinars at a lower price than if they purchase the tickets to the webinars individually. Another promotion could be a promotional code that can be given out to audience members who stay until the end of your webinars for a lower price on the tickets of the next webinar you are hosting.

<h2 id=""price"">1. Price Considerations</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-17382 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/money-webinars@2x.png"" alt=""paid webinars"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Pricing your webinar is a very important aspect of running a paid webinar. A webinar that is too expensive can dissuade potential audience members from participating, however, a webinar that is priced too cheap can lower the perceived value of it. Ensure that your pricing point increases the perceived value of your webinar, while not so high as to dissuade people from joining.
<h2 id=""chatroom"">2. Chat Room Experience</h2>
A chat room experience is a helpful tool that can increase the perceived value of your webinar. The ability to interact with other audience members of the webinar can be a helpful tool that keeps people engaged and less likely to leave the webinar early. Ensure that you as a speaker should ask questions to the audience and explicitly ask them to enter their thoughts in the chatbox. This can ensure increased engagement and keep people from leaving your webinar early.
<h2 id=""agenda"">3. On-Screen Agenda</h2>
People like to have a road map to see where they are going. Being kept in the blind can trigger thoughts of confusion and trepidation on what would come next. Having an agenda can help audience members follow along easier and capture the most important topics that they wanted to focus on during the webinar. In addition, an agenda does not only help your audience members but can also improve the speaker’s time management and experience. This can ensure the speaker stays on topic and manages his or her time in a manner that does not extend the duration of the webinar to encroach on audience member’s personal time.
<h2 id=""links"">4. Individual Zoom Links</h2>
Zoom is a very commonly used Web Conference software. Around 300 Million daily participants join Zoom meetings each day. Since it is so commonly used, most people will not need to install another piece of software to join your webinars when Zoom is used. The one main issue with Zoom meetings is that they can be joined by just having access to a link.

This means that if one person pays for your webinar they will be able to share that link to an unlimited number of people to join the webinar as well. Due to this fact, you need to have an integrated Zoom software that generates individual links that only a single person can use. Once you do that, you will be able to charge for webinars hosted through Zoom.
<h2 id=""platform"">5. Solid Platform</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16882 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/eventbank-blog-COVID@2x.png"" alt=""webinar tips"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

When hosting a webinar, many technological factors are at play. This creates a need that none of them go wrong during your webinar. Sometimes technological issues that happen can be out of your control, but regardless it conveys a sense of unprofessionalism. Ensure the platform that you are utilizing is a solid platform that has been tested and as many bugs as possible are eliminated prior to hosting your webinar.
<h2 id=""networking"">6. Networking Integration</h2>
Audience members who join a webinar tend to be working in the same industry or interested in similar topics. To create additional value for your audience members, who join your webinar, you should integrate an ability for them to able to network with each other. If audience members were able to design and send virtual business cards to each other, they would be gaining a lot more value from your webinar.

This can attract a new segment of audience members who join your webinar with people who have the same interests or work in the same industry as people who commonly join your webinar.
<h2 id=""contingency"">7. Contingency Plan</h2>
If something goes wrong when hosting your webinar, you should always have a back plan in place. If a speaker is not able to connect to the webinar for some reason, or drops out due to connection issues, another speaker should be already in place and ready to take over at a moment's notice. This ensures that your webinar runs its full length without extending the length of the webinar.
<h2 id=""reminders"">8. Reminders</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16810 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/eventbank-blog-phone@2x.png"" alt=""mobile notifications"" width=""2400"" height=""1288"" />

Reminders are important to send out to your audience members that have paid to attend your webinar. You do not want audience members missing your webinar because they have forgotten. However, reminders do not solely need to be based upon audience members who have registered, they can be sent to everyone in your network to increase the knowledge about your webinar. This could increase the number of registrations for your events.
<h2 id=""promotions"">9. Promotions</h2>
Promotions are a beneficial way to convince more people to register for your webinars. Promotions give a larger incentive for potential members to purchase a ticket to your webinar. 64% of consumers tend to wait for things to go on sale before purchasing them, so when a promotion is present, potential audience members will be more inclined to purchase tickets to your webinar.

Potential promotions can be a “season” of webinars at a lower price than if the webinars are purchased separately. Another promotional idea could be to include a promotional code at the end of your webinars. These codes can be given out to audience members who stay until the end of your webinars for a lower price on the tickets of the next webinar you are hosting.
<h2 id=""earlybird"">10. Early Bird Discounts</h2>
Early Bird Discounts can add up to 80% of your sales and they are a great way to boost the number of tickets you sell to potential audience members. When people see a discount next to the full price, they are more inclined to purchase the product or service because they believe that they believed they have rewarded something when they see the urgency of such a discount. While you may not be making as much revenue from each ticket as you would from selling full-price tickets, creating a sense of urgency can increase the number of audience members attending your webinar.
<h2 id=""consistency"">11. Consistency</h2>
People crave consistency in the very inconsistent world that we live in. Consistency often develops into a feeling of trust. Consistency can be achieved in two different aspects, the consistency of the webinar format and slides, and the consistency of the recurrence of webinars. If you ensure these two aspects stay consistent, audience members will start to trust you and begin to attend more of your webinars.
<h2 id=""feedback"">12. Feedback</h2>
Feedback is always important after a webinar because there is always room for improvement. As the presenter or host of the webinar, you may not see the potential small changes that could make that can vastly improve the experience of the audience members. By sending out a feedback form with open-ended questions, the feedback you receive can improve your webinars for your current audience members, as well as, improve the experience for future audience members.
<h2 id=""accessibility"">13. Accessibility</h2>
Accessibility is important to consider for your webinar. Programs need to be easy for your audience members to learn to use. Programs that need to be downloaded and installed should not have a steep learning curve, to not deter potential audience members from joining your webinars. Ideally, you would use a commonly used software that audience members would have previously downloaded, to mitigate a barrier of entry to your webinars.
<h2 id=""presenters"">14. Trained Presenters</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-17365 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sem-webinars@2x-1.png"" alt=""webinar speaker"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

You need to ensure that the people presenting the webinars are familiar with the software and are apt at dealing with frequently encountered issues swiftly while still presenting. This ensures a smooth transition between technical issues and the webinar.
<h2 id=""itcrew"">15. On-site IT Crew</h2>
On-site IT crews can help people with issues they encounter during the webinar. The ability to do a quick fix will create a positive webinar experience. To have an IT crew during the webinar, audience members can directly ask them questions during the webinar when they are having some issues rather than asking the presenter, disrupting the webinar. This creates more value for the audience member if they are having an issue because they would be able to attend the webinar as soon as the IT crew fixes their issue, rather than having to wait for the recorded webinar to be published
<h2 id=""deck"">16. Amazing slide deck</h2>
An amazing slide deck is an important factor in your webinars since the audience members will be mainly watching your slide decks as you present. Ensure that there is a professional standard set that you want to convey to your audience members. In addition to this, you should also verify that your slide deck is interesting. An uninteresting slide deck will bore your audience members and can drive them away from being repeat audience members of your webinar.
<h2 id=""punctual"">17. Be Punctual</h2>
Always arrive to the meeting early, because some people may join the meeting a bit early and you don’t want them thinking there are technical issues when they try to join. Being early doesn’t mean you start any earlier than planned, just be one step ahead so you can start your webinar on time. Planning to be early also ensures that if there are any technical issues from your end, you have time to fix it before the planned start time of the webinar.
<h2 id=""mistakes"">18. Acknowledge Mistakes and Technical Issues</h2>
When presenting your webinar, ensure that any mistakes that you see are noted and expressed to the audience. It is better to acknowledge your mistake before your audience points it out. If an audience member points out a mistake before you do, it can convey a sense of unprofessionalism. To point out and acknowledge your mistakes early on, it shows the audience that you do understand what you are talking about, however, you are still human and prone to mistakes.

In addition, if you should run into technical problems during the presentation of the webinar, acknowledge that you recognize the issue and have the tech team on standby work to resolve the issue as soon as possible.
<h2 id=""promotion"">19. Strong Promotion</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16470 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eventbank-exploration-patterns-1-copy-dfsdsd-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-2@2x-2.png"" alt=""marketing trends in 2020"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Promotion is an integral part of potential audience members learning about your webinar. For you to market it well, ensure you do market research on what platforms that your target audience members frequent. If you can market on those platforms, you would be reasonable to expect to have a larger number of the audience compared to promoting on a platform that your target audience members do not frequent.
<h2 id=""audience"">20. Know Your Audience</h2>
Ensure that you understand your target audience when picking a speaker, setting the webinar time, and also creating the slide deck. If you understand that your audience is individuals in the US wants to learn about Event Management Software, you would not be posting visuals on medical trends or hosting the webinar at 3pm in China which would be 3am on the East Coast of the United States. Ensure you have established your target audience, and cater to what they would like to see.
<h2 id=""branding"">21. Visual Branding</h2>
Your visual brand is the first touchpoint with your customers. Ensure that you have strong visual branding because if you do, potential audience members may develop a preliminary sense of trust in you. The visual brand needs to be consistent in all marketing materials or any materials that potential audience members will see.

A weak, inconsistent visual brand will portray a sense of unprofessionalism and can deter potential audience members from joining. But a strong visual brand will have them interested, which is the first step that eventually converts them into audience members for your webinar.
<h2 id=""mobile"">22. Mobile Device Integration</h2>
25% of people sign into webinars from a mobile device, and to include this population of audience members into your webinar audience, implement mobile device compatibility into your webinar. This does not create a sense of exclusivity and deter the members of your audience who plan to sign in on a mobile device.
<h2 id=""schedule"">23. Stay on Schedule</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-17196 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tips-communities-going-digital.png"" alt=""webinar technology"" width=""1200"" height=""644"" />

Always assume your audience members may have commitments before or after your webinars. Ensure that you start your webinars on time and also end within the allotted time slot you have promoted. This ensures that audience members no longer need to leave your webinars early.

Moreover, it shows that you value your audience members' time. This will create a positive experience for your audience members and will increase your retention of your audience members because they know that they can plan things after your webinar and ensures the efficiency of planning their schedules.
<h2 id=""faqs"">24. Present FAQ’s</h2>
Having audience members participate in a Q &amp; A may be a daunting task for them. In order for some questions to be asked, you might want to start by establishing some frequently asked questions and answer them. Not only does this answer some of your audience members' questions, but it can also encourage audience members to ask other questions that they may have.
<h2 id=""timing"">25. Timing</h2>
The timing of your webinars can affect the number of potential audience members joining your webinars. You would need to pick a time that is convenient for your audience members to join. If the timing for them is not ideal they would not buy tickets to your webinar. Statistically speaking, most people join webinars between the 11am to 2pm time slots in the middle of the workweek. You can use this as a basis for your hosting times
<h2 id=""recording"">26. Webinar Recording</h2>
Extenuating circumstances always come up in our lives and can alter our original plans. This could mean that some of your audience members may not be able to join a certain webinar on a certain date after they registered for it. You should not penalize your audience members for it, rather, you should have a recorded version of your webinar uploaded to those who signed up for the webinar. Not only can people who missed the webinar watch it, people who are going back to reuse it for reference can also re-watch it.
<h2 id=""launch"">27. Start Your Webinar</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-17341 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/emails-blog@2x.png"" alt=""webinar invite email examples"" width=""2400"" height=""1288"" />

Our last tip is for you to start planning your next webinar. To have a successful webinar, you must first start planning for one and hosting it. Not all of these strategies apply to everyone and you should pick which ones can be implemented for your own webinars.

17578,"Providing Value to Members in a Post-Pandemic World","Asia Pacific’s top association leaders came together in a recent webinar to discuss how associations can provide value to their members on the road to recovery from coronavirus. The actions that associations take over the next few months will make the difference in associations that find success and those who don’t.

The panel included the following panelists: Datuk Dr. Raj Abdul Karim, the President of the Malaysian Council of Child Welfare and Chair of the Malaysian Society of Association Executives; Charles Villasenor, the Chairman at the Philippine Council of Associations and Association Executives; Antonio Codinach, the Regional Business Director of APAC of PCMA; and Marcel Ewals, the Director of Associations and Marketing of MCI Group. The panelists gave insights into the impact of the pandemic and strategies to help associations when moving forward.
<h2>Important Factors</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16672 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/value-copy-58@1x.png"" alt=""conference networking tips"" width=""1200"" height=""644"" />

The pandemic has undoubtedly left the event industry in huge trouble. It’s a wake-up call for businesses: it’s the most serious shift the industry has faced and is forcing associations to rethink their business models. We may never go back to the same industry that we had before. Taking this into account, there are a couple main things that associations must do in order to move forward.

First, remember that you hold influence in your society! The trajectory of the event business is going to be largely impacted by the decisions of your local government. It’s extremely important to advocate the government to support local businesses during the shutdown and as reopening begins. This could mean the difference between surviving the pandemic and shutting down.

Another thing to consider is the importance of communication with your members. Use online events to reach your audience. Ask what they need in the current situation and how your association can help them. Get feedback on how you’re doing and ask what challenges they expect to experience in the future.

Use this communication to provide content and education that offers value to them. The more you understand the needs of your members, the more you will be able to curate differentiated content.

Finally, associations must consider the effect that an online work environment is having on their employees. Without face to face interaction, it is harder to communicate with employees and maintain morale. Association leaders must communicate with their employees and help to keep them motivated within the associations.

Develop communication plans, immediately shift all efforts online, and reach out to employees individually. If your employees are not motivated and contributing towards moving forward, it could mean failure for your association.
<h2>Immediate Short-Term Strategy</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16661 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/value-copy-20@2x.png"" alt=""chamber of commerce myths and misconceptions"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

This crisis is similar to those of the past, such as 9/11 or the market crash of 2008, in that the success of businesses is coming down to their resilience. However, unlike these past events, we have no definite timeline for recovery. There is no telling whether this will be a couple of months of economic downturn or many years. Thus, associations must form strategies that take this uncertainty into account.

When building a strategy, associations must react quickly. Restructure your organization as fast as possible in order to survive. Cash is extremely important- associations are already dealing with diminishing or halted cash flow, and many will run out of money if they do not make these adjustments quickly enough.

When considering new strategies, associations should also put measures in place that will allow them to rapidly adjust based on what happens in the future. Associations should also consider the long term implications of these crises and adapt to these- for example, even once governments permit large events, how will customers react and readjust?

In addition, associations should be wary of any emotional decisions. It can be extremely difficult to quickly adjust or shift away from methods that have been used forever and been successful in the past, but innovating new solutions is the only way associations will move forward. Associations must take a step back and look from a hostile point of view. Changing times require changing strategies.

With these high levels of uncertainty, however, also come opportunities. Associations must stay aware of the changing industries and changing demands. For example, we’re seeing an opening in the certification industry and online education. Formulate a business plan that takes advantage of these new opportunities. Every association has the opportunity to rediscover their industry amidst the crisis.
<h2>New Revenue Models</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16137 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/value-copy-58@2x.png"" alt=""key members"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

This shift online is also forcing associations to rethink their revenue models. In-person events are a large driver of revenue, especially in Asia. Associations are facing the challenge of how to monetize their online communities.

When looking to monetize online events, associations must analyze the demand side of the business to determine where they can provide value and plan their supply chain according to that. After determining where they can provide this value, they must look for the source: how do you get the components in your event to create that value?

This could mean working with technology players and other service providers to bring complementing components to the product. Then, associations can operationalize this product so that members will come back and be willing to pay for it.

Associations must also consider their competition: it’s no longer just the local associations. The competition is now heightened to the global landscape and is not limited to other event organizers. Tech companies themselves are also competitors.

For example, for things like online certifications, associations may not be equipped to compete with the array of competitors. Therefore, associations need to plan and source appropriately to be able to compete. Remember that the ability to organize events doesn’t necessarily translate to the ability to organize webinars or live experience.

To combat this increased competition, associations should seek sponsorship or work alongside other industry players.
<h2><b>Membership Model</b></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16091 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/value-copy-57@2x.png"" alt=""membership strategy"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

One trend that we are seeing amidst the coronavirus crisis is associations offering free membership. Is this something your association should be doing?

This all depends on how much of your revenue is generated from memberships. For example, associations in the United States usually generate half their revenue from membership payments, whereas associations in India generate far less from membership.

Offering free membership is a way of reaching out as an association and shows your members that you care for them. If you decide to offer it, make sure to use it your advantage and use it to grow your membership base.

If associations offer free membership without considering the financial implications for their specific associations and without utilizing it to its full advantage by generating new members, it will just burn cash. Ensure that your choice is right for your associations and aligns with your redefined value proposition.
<h2>Online Business Model</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-17196 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tips-communities-going-digital.png"" alt=""webinar technology"" width=""1200"" height=""644"" />

Converting live events onto a virtual platform is obviously the easiest solution in the current climate. However, this should not be an ad hoc solution by any means: when converting their events, associations must take the time to truly analyze their online business model and connect with their members.

To develop an online business model, communication with customers is key. Through time, find regular touchpoints within the industry that you are focused on. After webinars, follow up and collect attendee feedback. Determine what real value you are offering through your online services. Once this is determined, <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/paid-webinar-strategies/"">you can then begin to monetize</a>.

Consider the changes you need to make to your content and your staff as you make this switch. From a content perspective, there are a lot of professionals who may be very experienced in live events, but unable to convert this experience online. How can your association help and educate them to become outstanding virtual facilitators and speakers?

In terms of staff, look at the talent within your organization. Do you have the right talent for the right jobs? What’s coming next requires creating new roles and redefining old roles.

Finally, consider how you are going to program your webinar. How will you convert a three-day conference into an online event that people are interested in participating in? People have a current attention span of eight seconds, so we really need to change the dynamics of these events and program webinars like a TV show.

Use customer feedback to determine how long to make your live events and ensure that customers are staying engaged.
<h2>Going Forward</h2>
Lots of uncertainty lies ahead, but one thing is for sure. The industry will never go back to the way it was before with an overwhelmed supply of face to face events. Recovery is going to entail a better combination of face to face engagement and digital aspects. The way that this fusion looks for your association is up to you, based on your value proposition and your market.

17613,"What’s a Digital Business Card and How Do I Get One?","Digital business cards are a new concept that’s been slowly advancing toward day-to-day use by leveraging smartphones that sit in every professional’s pocket these days. Its user adoption has been slow, but subtle hints at its emergence in 2020 are becoming more and more apparent. But if you’re out of the loop and not sure what a digital business card entails, we’ll break it down and answer some frequently asked questions about what they are, how they work, and how you can get one.
<h2>What is a digital business card?</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-17276 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/business-carrd@2x.png"" alt=""webinar digital business card exchange"" width=""1986"" height=""1666"" />

A digital business card is, at its core, a business card that exists online under an account you own and can log into at any time. It has all your contact information, title, company name, logo, and everything you would expect on a business card.

With a range of platforms hosting digital business cards, you can actually a few more goodies that make it more interactive and engaging for recipients, like adding optional additional info, portfolio of work, and more.

LinkedIn has, in fact, been a de-facto digital business card for professionals looking for ways to keep in touch, but its a social aspect, constant news feeds, publicity, and the fact that you can’t easily export your contacts, leads to LinkedIn being a somewhat less optimal way to digitally exchange contact info.

A digital business card should be easily exchanged, easily managed, and easily accessible.
<h2>Why use digital business cards?</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16414 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eventbank-exploration-patterns-1-copy-dfsdsd-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy@2x.png"" alt=""digital membership cards"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Aside from the more green aspect of using a digital business card over a physical one, a digital business card never needs to be replenished, and it can be exchanged both in person, as well as online.

A digital business card also has the added benefit of interacting with physical business cards so that any person you might run into who doesn’t share your fondness of digital business cards can still not only hand you their card, but the card can be scanned into your database of choice. This is a feature existing in some CRMs, but with a digital business card involved, the experience can be reciprocal to your contacts.

Further, digital cards are dynamic, and can be edited any time should you change work, title, or contact info, removing the headache of ordering new cards.
<h2>How do digital business cards work?</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16516 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eventbank-exploration-patterns-1-copy-dfsdsd-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-3@2x.png"" alt=""chambers and associations"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Digital business cards can come in a few different varieties, but essentially it’s a piece of content that is not public but is shareable. It emulates the information a business card would have about you, albeit with a few extras and functionality you wouldn’t normally get on a physical card.

You might find a digital business card existing on your phone, on a social media platform, a community platform, or potentially just it’s own app on your phone or desktop. The cards can then be shared with others at your whim, either through a link, QR code, or a handshake popup or notification on a centralized platform for this sort of communication (think LinkedIn notifications for requests to connect, but not publicly).

Some extra functionality can be the ability to scan physical cards so they’ve saved in your digital Rolodex, making it a lot more conscionable to tidy up your physical cards that seem to grow year on year.

This means you can share your business card digitally to contacts on webinars, through group chats, or even in-person should they hand you a physical card, completing the bridge between your digital and physical networking strategy.
<h2>Where can I get a digital business card?</h2>
[caption id=""attachment_5466"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""600""]<img class=""wp-image-5466 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-2.png"" alt=""Digital Membership Cards"" width=""600"" height=""600"" /> <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/digital-membership-cards/"">Digital Membership cards</a> were the brainchild to digital business cards in the MICE industry.[/caption]

This tech is actually still in its infancy, as we eluded to prior, social platforms like LinkedIn are already doing the job of connecting professionals but in a public manner that doesn’t include direct-contact information that makes it easier to communicate. LinkedIn Connects you, but it doesn’t glue you together.

Some platforms are attempting to release their own versions of the digital business card, and for the time being, it seems like there will be many platforms competing for the market until a leader emerges. Or, on the other side of things, it will simply be a feature that begins to standardize itself in current platforms, time will only tell.

As for where you can get a digital business card right now?

Try checking out a few like Dibiz, Haystack, Ingio, or Switchit App, however, you’ll find them somewhat lacking in the functionality that we’ve mentioned before. Some apps even require the other person you want to exchange with to have the exact same app in order to exchange. It’s not a perfect solution, but there could be some good internal uses here should you need them.

At EventBank we’ve built our communities to leverage their own internal business card exchange during events, webinars, or simply in the real &amp; digital world so that attendees and organization members can better network without getting in the way of community discussions and activities.

17923,"21 Webinar Survey Questions to Ask Before, During, and After","Surveys are an important aspect when it comes to webinars and events because it provides feedback and information from your audience members you may not be able to receive any other way. Surveys can assist in an objective view of your webinars and see the improvements you can make. This creates a higher accuracy than relying on gut feeling. It can also help you with the future targeting of audiences by looking at target populations and analyzing the data. <b>In short, surveys can help you improve the quality and the customer perceived value of your webinars and events.</b>

<h2>Tips for Designing a Webinar Survey</h2>
<img class=""alignnone wp-image-17304 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/eventbank-webinars-network.png"" alt=""webinar networking"" width=""1200"" height=""644"" />

When you send your survey out, you want to have as many participants respond to the survey as possible. This ensures that you get the most feedback from the participants which can be used to improve your webinar and also lowers the possibility of skewed results. These tips below can ensure that more people follow through with your survey and not immediately be deterred when they open the form.
<h3>Start with the Easy Questions</h3>
When designing your webinar survey, start with the easy questions first. The easy questions can consist of true/false, or multiple-choice questions. Starting with the easier questions allows the participant to be more willing to start filling out the survey because of the perceived belief that it would be a quick survey, and not take up a lot of their time. And as the survey goes on, you put your open-ended questions near the end. This ensures the participants will be more willing to complete your survey because they have already invested their time in it.
<h3>Not too Long</h3>
Your survey should never be too long because a long survey will deter your participants from filling out the survey and lower the quality of your survey answers. A survey that takes 20 mins or more to complete will start having less thoughtful and lower quality responses. In order to have your participants fill out a survey with good information, make sure that your survey takes less than 15-20 minutes to complete.
<h3>Limit the Choices</h3>
When writing a closed-ended question, ensure that you do not have too many decisions for your participants to choose from. More choices often lead to worse user experiences. In order to limit create a good user experience, limit the choices. But if there are many choices needed, you can always put an “other” option where your participant can fill out their choice.
<h2 id=""before"">Pre-Webinar Questions</h2>
<img class=""alignnone wp-image-17341 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/emails-blog@2x.png"" alt=""webinar invite email examples"" width=""2400"" height=""1288"" />

Pre-Webinar questions are a good way to gauge the interest of the audience for your webinar and it can help with some aspects of the planning process. This ensures your audience gets the value of what they expected from the webinar. In addition, this early engagement with the audience members before your webinar will also encourage them to attend the webinar when the day comes.
<h3>1. Which speakers are you excited about?</h3>
This question can help you understand who the webinar audiences want to see. This can assist in your planning by allowing that speaker to have more time sharing their ideas and also have them speak at more of your webinars to increase the number of paying audience members.
<h3>2. Have you attended our events or webinars before?</h3>
This question illustrates the number of audience members that are returning customers. This shows your customer retention rate. Loyal audience members prove that you are hitting the right topics for your target audience.
<h3>3. How did you hear about this webinar?</h3>
Finding out where audience members heard about your events can help you decide on what platforms to market your webinars. Increased promotion on these platforms can help you with an uptick in sales for your webinar.
<h3>4. Why did you choose to attend this webinar?</h3>
This can help you figure out what aspects of the webinar are the most attractive to audience members. You could be picking all the right topics that audience members are currently interested in, or your audience members could be really pleased with your speakers. Figuring out what you are doing right can help you continue doing it right.
<h3>5. What device are you planning on using?</h3>
If different audience members are planning on using different devices, such as a mobile device, your webinar platform needs to be able to support that. A webinar platform that can support all the devices that your audience members are using will not deter any audience member from any future webinars.
<h3>6. Was there any information that was hard to find?</h3>
Some information that the audience member may want or need may not be readily available for them before the webinar. Asking this question can ensure all the necessary information was provided to the audience member ahead of time.
<h2 id=""during"">During Webinar Questions</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16882 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/eventbank-blog-COVID@2x.png"" alt=""webinar tips"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />
<h3>7. Are there any tech issues you are experiencing?</h3>
Tech issues can occur during your webinars and they could ruin an audience member’s experience of your webinar. Asking this question allows some audience members to bring up an issue that the tech team can try to fix it for them. You could have a separate survey box that is consistently open so they can ask for help whenever needed.
<h3>8. Are there any things you would like the speakers to elaborate on?</h3>
This survey question can be sent out through the webinar platform near the end of the webinar. This ensures that the audience members do get the information they joined the webinar for. This creates value for your audience members and incentivizes them to become repeat customers
<h3>9. Are there any questions?</h3>
This is always an important question to ask that can be on a survey on your platform. Being an open-ended question the audience members can ask any question to the topics they are confused about. Audience members who have their questions cleared up leave with higher satisfaction.
<h2 id=""after"">Post-Webinar Questions</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16810 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/eventbank-blog-phone@2x.png"" alt=""mobile notifications"" width=""2400"" height=""1288"" />

Post webinar questions can arguably be the most important questions you ask. When you send out your post-webinar survey, you get feedback on the delivery of your webinar, which is the product/service that your audience members paid for. All feedback negative or positive can help improve your webinars to keep the most amount of recurring customers.
<h3>10. How would you rate the webinar?</h3>
This is a simple question that gets straight to the point with your audience members. This question should be asked in a scaled format and allows you to gather how much your audience enjoyed your webinar. If they enjoyed it, you are doing something right. If they did not enjoy it, you need to figure out what's wrong and change it before you lose all your audience members.
<h3>11. How would you rate the speakers?</h3>
The speakers are an integral part of your webinars. Amazing speakers can be a great benefit to your webinars. When your recurring audience members enjoy the speakers that are a part of your webinars, it keeps them as recurring customers and improves the overall value of your webinar.
<h3>12. How would you rate the technology?</h3>
The technological aspect of webinars is one of the most important things to consider. Since everything needs to be done online on computers, the technology has to work for all your audience members. If you could get feedback on how to improve aspects of your tech, it would improve your audience member’s experiences.
<h3>13. Were your expectations met?</h3>
Going into a webinar, your audience members will have an internal expectation of the quality and the value that they are predicting they would get out of the webinar. Of course, you would want to meet the expectation at the least. But knowing whether or not audience members were impressed by the webinar or were disappointed can prove invaluable data for you and the future of your webinars.
<h3>14. How satisfied are you with the networking tools?</h3>
Networking is important for may of your audience members who join your webinars. You must provide good networking tools to create value for your audience members. If the tools are up-to-par, you would be creating value not only on the information shared on your webinar but also the connections they make attending it.
<h3>15. Would you contact someone you networked within the webinar?</h3>
The next step of good networking tools is that the audience members contact the people they networked with during the webinar. If they are planning on contacting the people they networked with, they are getting an additional value, which is good for the perception of your webinar
<h3>16. Has your perception of the company improved through the webinar?</h3>
Having your audience members have a more positive perception of your company can increase sales. And if your webinar helps drive revenue from ticket sales as well as increases the perception of your company, you are killing two birds with one stone!
<h3>17. What were your favorite/least favorite moments in the webinar?</h3>
This helps you identify the driving factors on why an audience member may become a recurring audience member or not. Focusing on the positive aspects and ensuring that they do not falter while improving the negative aspects will improve your webinar overall.
<h3>18. Did you find the platform easy to use?</h3>
An easy to use platform for a webinar is crucial for repeat audience members. Because of a gentle learning curve, more people will be able to join the webinar and be more willing to come back because it does not require difficult planning on their end.
<h3>19. How likely would you recommend this webinar to a friend?</h3>
If your audience members enjoy your webinars and recommend your webinar to a friend, it can drive ticket sales. This can also increase the number of recurring audience members you have.
<h3>20. Will you join our next event?</h3>
This is a straightforward question that can help you figure out who would become a recurring customer or not. High numbers mean that you have hosted a successful webinar, low numbers mean that there are improvements to be made.
<h3>21. Any improvements that can be made to the webinar?</h3>
There are always improvements to be made to your webinar to create more customer value. Some of these improvements may not be highlighted by your other survey questions, so make sure this is an open-ended question, and that your audience members can explain and give their feedback.
<h2>Value of Information</h2>
Information about your webinar from your audience is of immense value. Always remember that you are trying to <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/successful-webinar-strategies/"">create value</a> for them so they will keep attending your webinars. Take their feedback and use it to build even better webinars in the future, and you're sure to see your online events skyrocket in popularity and value.

18068,"Hybrid-Webinar Events: Combining Your Online and Offline Attendees","Have you ever heard of a webinar hybrid event? Starting from the beginning, during Covid-19, businesses switch their entire events strategy to almost entirely online events and webinars.

This obviously provides the opportunity of still hosting events at a time when physical events are not possible, but a lot is left to be desired when it comes to being on a webinar, mainly engagement, networking, and ticketing. (Though we do have a guide that helps you get around these obstacles.)

But now as we see cities opening up, we’re in a weird limbo of being able to go out to meetings and conferences again but just locally, as we’re still unable to travel to most other areas to attend far distance events. This is where a hybrid webinar-conference might start to make sense.
<h2>What’s a Hybrid Webinar?</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-17365 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sem-webinars@2x-1.png"" alt=""webinar speaker"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

<b>A webinar hybrid is a physical in-person event or series of in-person events that have been integrated seamlessly with an online audience</b> who can listen to speakers, engage with activities, and network with attendees both online and offline.

A hybridized event is more than just a live stream of an event to an online audience, it’s an event that’s run on a platform that benefits both attendees on the event floor and those watching online by providing a digital space for the two audiences to interact, while still attending the same content.

Some hybrid events even use this aspect to host <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/event-spaces-going-digital/"">multiple in-person events across the world</a> in different locations, so the same event can take place in different cities simultaneously, while still having each audience come together as a whole digital audience online
<h2>Examples of Hybrid Webinars</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16951 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/eventbank-webinars@2x.png"" alt=""digital meeting"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Imagine you’re at an event and you’re in the crowd watching the panel discussion for instance. There's 40 something people in the room, but there could be hundreds more watching from online.

After the event, you want to talk and network with your fellow attendees, so talk to some folks in the room, but what about those hundreds of other viewers from the internet?

Just flip out your phone and just like that, you can open an app that gets you in touch with communities, chat rooms, business card exchanges, Q&amp;A forums, and more so that you can engage and network with both online and offline audiences.

On the reverse side, if you’re not able to travel for any reason, but you still want to attend a popular conference out of the country, simply log into the event online and you’ll be tuned into the event’s speakers, panels, shows, etc.

But now, with a hybridized event, you’re not just tuned into the event’s content, you’re also on an engaging platform that is helping you communicate with other attendees who are online, and those that are on the floor. Discuss in live chats for each session of the event, submit live polls according to event types, exchange digital business cards, and more.
<h2>Launching a Hybrid Event</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16672 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/value-copy-58@1x.png"" alt=""conference networking tips"" width=""1200"" height=""644"" />

Launching a hybrid event is a semi-complex situation, but most platforms these days that you’re used to using to handle your event management needs are similar in a lot of respects.
<h3>What you’re used to</h3>
Some things you may be familiar with in a hybrid webinar platform are some of the basics that don’t disappear suddenly because you’re hybridizing your event.

You’ll need a <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/digital-transformation-attendee-experience/""><b>contact management system</b></a>, or<b> CRM</b>, an <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/webinar-invite-email-examples/""><b>email marketing tool</b></a>, an <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/event-website-templates/""><b>event website or webpage</b></a>, and a <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/paid-webinar-strategies/""><b>ticketing interface</b></a> for attendees to register and optionally purchase tickets.

Nothing about these needs has changed for any reason when concerning a hybrid event, and more or less you’ve likely used them before. If not, there’s plenty of documentation that comes with most basic event management software that can explain it for you.

In a nutshell, the pre-event preparation is going to be similar with some slight deviance in wording, including making it clear in your promotional materials and website that the event is both for in-person attendees and viewers online.

The difficult part is accurately explaining that online attendees can engage with attendees on the event floor, and this wording concern is still a learning curve for first-time hybrid event organizers.
<h3>What you’re not used to</h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15108 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/eventbank-exploration-patterns-1-copy-13@2x.png"" alt=""event data collection"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

However, what you may not be used to when running a hybridized webinar, is the level of digital interface needed to seamlessly engage both online and offline audiences.

This includes properly preparing any speakers, panelists, or hosts with the running of the show and how the in-person show is inexorably intertwined with the online audience, and that their online viewers are just as interactive with the event itself as the people on the show floor.

For instance, the first thing needed to be tackled is the platform itself, and understanding what a hybrid platform does to make these engagements happen.

This could be a <b>live chat room</b>, a <b>live <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/successful-webinar-strategies/"">stream/webinar module</a></b>, <b> live polling, <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/digital-business-cards/"">digital business card exchanging</a>, <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/attendee-messaging/"">direct messaging</a>, </b>and more<b>. </b>

These types of engagement mediums are probably something not implemented in typical physical events, while some may be present in webinars.

It’s about having a mindset that these engagements are optional, but also encourage that they are used so that both online and offline audiences can benefit.

Remember that a lot of the reason people want to attend events is for the networking aspect, and by completing the bridge between the online and offline audience, you’ve now provided an astounding amount of value to your hybrid event.

You’ve bridged gaps that have existed for years, and you’ve removed a lot of cons for both event types by doing so while keeping all the pros.

18105,"7 Survey Best Practices for Events and Webinars","We always like to tout the effectiveness of attendee tracking, analytics, and personalization for the purpose of gauging event and webinar success, but at the end of the day hearing feedback from the attendees themselves will always trump any analytics.

However, you <i>can</i> mess up how you deliver a survey by not following some best practices like:

<a href=""#platform"">Choosing a Decent Survey Platform</a>
<a href=""#questions"">Crafting Short and Sweet Questions</a>
<a href=""#purpose"">Explain the Survey’s Purpose</a>
<a href=""#completion"">Never Require 100% Completion</a>
<a href=""#proritize"">Prioritize Important Questions First</a>
<a href=""#time"">Mention the Estimated Completion Time</a>
<a href=""#results"">Share the Results</a>
<h2 id=""platform"">1. Choosing a Decent Survey Platform</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-17277 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/webinar-solution-eventbank@2x.png"" alt=""webinar management software"" width=""1367"" height=""1080"" />

Surveys aren’t done on paper anymore, events and webinars these days can get into the thousands of attendees, and going digital with survey deliver make it easier to deal with all the responses.

This however makes it less engaging, as a lot of attendees feel a need to complete a paper-form survey handed to them during an event than if it just arrived in an email in their inbox.

So from the get-go, dealing with digital surveys will take some tact to make them engaging so you can maximize their effectiveness. It also goes without saying that webinars are solely digital surveys anyways.

Choosing an effective survey platform or provider is entirely up to how you deal with your digital attendee engagement, and likely that revolves around using a CRM or <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/best-event-management-software/"">event management software</a>.

There is notable software for specializing in surveys out there like SurveyMonkey, but it’s important to make sure you’re automatically updating attendee profiles in your CRM automatically with responses, and for that, please read their integrations page for more details.

For a more embedded experience, event management platforms are offering surveys built into their apps or even their email marketing platforms. These are native, internal integrations that likely work much better and remove an unnecessary cost from the software side of things.

As for what to look for in a survey tool, the only real importance is how much editing power you have over the tool and how that data is used once collected.

Most tools do a good job of this as survey tools have become more standardized over time, but still, make sure you have some available admin rights in order to follow throw with more of our advice coming up in this article, like for instance, the ability to give Skip Logic to survey questions.
<h2 id=""questions"">2. Crafting Short and Sweet Questions</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-10958 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/blog-post-43-copy@2x.png"" alt=""event room layouts"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Short and sweet questions easy to answer, and give probably the same information as to what you’re looking for.

A rookie mistake when surveying anyone is that you want them to be ultra detailed with their answers and get as much feedback as possible from one subject. It’s not possible, and frankly it just scares people away from starting it.

Your questions should be directly asking what you’re looking to improve. Do you just want a score of 1 to 10 how good was the event or webinar they just attended? Simply ask that.

You can also extend these qualitative or multi-choice questions a bit longer, maybe towards 5-10 questions if they’re all equally short and simple too. Some people seem to have an obsession with completing fill-in questions, so they may actually complete it in full.

No need to ask them to write down their experience, it’s just not necessary, but by all means, leave a comments section at the end anyways for their optional feedback.

However, if you need constructive feedback, now is the time to ask one or two open-ended questions that are specific to what you feel you can tackle coming up.

Asking how the A/V set up was when you have no budget for new A/V equipment is likely the wrong question since it’s not something actionable. So make sure when you ask constructive questions, they're questions with whom’s answers can be acted upon directly.
<h2 id=""purpose"">3. Explain the Survey’s Purpose</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16470 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eventbank-exploration-patterns-1-copy-dfsdsd-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-2@2x-2.png"" alt=""marketing trends in 2020"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Make sure in your delivery or promotion of the survey after your event, that you explain the purpose of the survey.

Everyone knows what a survey is, but if you can explain why you’re surveying them and what that survey may lead to, it would actually propel some individuals to complete the survey.

We wish we had more tips for you, but this is as simple as it gets, add a message in your delivery that shows your intent of the survey and what it may lead to.

For instance if you’re looking to improve speaker quality at events and webinars you host in the future, maybe you should just say that in your survey delivery email: “Your answers will help us improve the quality of speaker selection in the future.”.
<h2 id=""completion"">4. Never Require 100% Completion</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16810 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/eventbank-blog-phone@2x.png"" alt=""mobile notifications"" width=""2400"" height=""1288"" />

In any survey, never require a single question. Yes, you may get bogus feedback, missing data, and so on, but missing data is better than no data. Some questions may come off as too uncomfortable, or maybe they just don’t have feedback or anything to say.

Making it non-compulsive to complete every single question will lead to more actual submissions of feedback, and overall you’ll have more data to use, even if every delivery was not 100 percent complete.

When analytically looking at this data though, it’s important that if you have qualitative questions, do not divide your percentage of completion by total number of survey submissions, but by submissions that have answered that question and not skipped it like others may have.
<h2 id=""prioritize"">5. Prioritize Important Questions First</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16558 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/eventbank-exploration-patterns-1-copy-5@2x.png"" alt=""content prioritization"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Piggybacking off our advice on never requiring 100% completion of a survey, we still want you to get the pertinent feedback that’s important for you, and so our advice is to make sure that the first questions in your survey are ordered from most important to least important.

Doing so will ensure the of those who do attempt to complete, or mostly complete, a survey will deliver your most valued feedback first.
<h2 id=""time"">6. Mention the Estimated Completion Time</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16965 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-young-professionals@2x.png"" alt=""young professionals"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

In the delivery of your survey, mention either how many questions the survey is, the estimated time of completion, or both.

It’s a simple gesture that helps your recipients better gauge their time-cost of completing the survey and likely will entice more people to complete because it’s not as long as they first though.

Likely because you followed our advice on short and sweet questions, right? ;)
<h2 id=""results"">7. Share the Results</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16771 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/eventbank-blog@2x.png"" alt=""in person event seminars"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Finally, after the survey period is over, be sure to share the results of the survey with those that completed the survey.

You can even use this aspect to promote users to finish the survey when you deliver it. By saying only those that complete the survey will receive the results, you’ve added some exclusivity to the recipients and likely incentivized the curious ones to complete the survey.

Be sure that when sending the survey results, you understand the survey feedback type. If it was a simple multi-choice or qualitative questionnaire, then you can probably just deliver them directly as-is compiled into a nice graph or chart.

However, a questionnaire with more personalized feedback might need to be collected, reviewed, and then summarized for recipients of the results. Make sure it shows not only a summary of the major feedback but also it’s a great time to either reinforce or otherwise double down on what action you’ll take to improve future events based on their feedback.

18123,"The Ultimate Webinar Sponsorship Guide","With the COVID-19 pandemic severely limiting events and opportunities to host large scale events, many companies are now shifting their gears to hosting online webinars and other virtual events.

Some companies are offering their webinars for free but many other companies are utilizing <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/paid-webinar-strategies/"">paid webinars</a> to boost value and make some profit on their webinars with the use of webinar management software that adds more engagement to the typical webinar platform like ticketing, account log-ins, communities, <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/survey-events-webinars/"">live polling</a>, <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/digital-business-cards/"">virtual business card exchanging</a>, and more.

These companies are usually charging their audience members for tickets but that puts all the cost of the webinars on your audience members, which could be limiting.

It could lessen the number of audience members that <strong>may not be able or be willing to pay for your webinars, but are still very much engaged with your brand</strong>.

In addition, it could limit the amount you can charge each audience member to ensure that the audience members see that the value from participation is much higher than the price of the webinar.

Sponsorships are another means to generate revenue without putting all the cost on your audience members and also create some partnerships with other companies that could benefit from sponsoring your webinars, the long term benefits are without understatement.

But first, ask yourself this:
<h2>Are Sponsorships Valuable to You?</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-17548 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/june-edm@2x.png"" alt=""webinar value"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Sponsorships on Webinars, not unlike events, can be valuable to you. Not too many reasons would spring to mind when considering Sponsorships for webinars.

You don’t need to rent out a physical space, catering is not needed, audiences who need to travel, and so on, however, sponsorships still can bring monetary aid as well as credibility to your webinars. Sometimes, the sponsorship leading to having the right logo on promotional materials is enough already.
<h3>Budget</h3>
Sponsorships can help with your budget as you may be able to generate more revenue than you could have without them.

If you opt-in for a ticket based audience registration as well as sponsoring companies, you would be maximizing the revenue generated from your webinars.

However, if you could use your sponsorship to lower the ticket prices for your audience members, then you could increase the value of the webinar for them by making it more affordable.

This can lead to larger webinar audiences which can increase your sponsors and your revenue, creating a positive feedback loop.
<h3>Credibility</h3>
Sponsorships by companies that are well known can help you improve the credibility of your webinars.

With all the webinars popping up during these times, people will be more likely to trust webinars that are sponsored by a credible company. This would increase your credibility as well as registrations for your event.
<h3>Beware of Shark-Sponsors</h3>
Be wary of sponsors that seek to leverage your webinar for their own benefit by flaunting the rules, claiming credit, or otherwise disrupting the event in a means to their benefit only.

It may seem strange, but some sponsors out there will use their large brand image to disrupt entire events and webinars in both minor or major ways, from claiming credit or otherwise marketing the event as if it was their own, giving away free tickets to registrants that buy their products, and so on.
<h2>How to Find Sponsors</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16951 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/eventbank-webinars@2x.png"" alt=""digital meeting"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

There are steps that you need to follow before you can attain the right sponsors for your webinar. The first thing needed is to find the right sponsors for your event.

Additionally, you need to convince the sponsors that they are the right sponsor for your event and that they would be getting value from sponsoring your event as well.
<h3>Transfer Your Event Sponsors</h3>
This one is quite easy. If you ran events with sponsors in the past, simply reach out to them and see if they'd be interested in sponsoring your online events as well. Webinars have come a long way, and sponsorship of webinars is becoming just as fruitful as in-person events, thanks to leaps in<a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/successful-webinar-strategies/""> technology making engagement easier online</a>.
<h3>Getting The Right Sponsors</h3>
Getting the right sponsors for your webinars is an important consideration to make when looking for webinar sponsors.

The wrong sponsors can hinder your progress and could convey a message that was not your attention and attract the wrong audience members.

The right sponsors can help you target your audience a little bit better, and attract positive media attention as well as larger amounts of audience members.
<h3>Know Your Webinar</h3>
Knowing your webinar topic and target audiences can help you immensely in finding the right sponsors for your webinar.

This can help you find the potential sponsors you would be happy partnering with. Knowing all the information about your webinar can also help you answer questions to the sponsors you reach out to.

Many sponsors will have a myriad of questions to figure out if they believe that sponsoring your event is a good fit for them.

Having the information readily available can convey a higher sense of professionalism.
<h3>Target Your Audience</h3>
Knowing your target audience is an important step to any webinar, it allows you to cater to your topic and your presentation to your audience. But knowing what companies your target audiences frequent or have a positive view of can help you pick the right sponsors for your webinars.

Picking these sponsors can help you drive higher attendance and registration for your webinars from your target audience.
<h2>Proving ROI</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15478 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/value-copy-18@2x-1.png"" alt=""association revenue ideas"" width=""2400"" height=""1288"" />

Providing ROI on previous sponsors for your webinars can be beneficial in convincing new sponsors to become new sponsors of your webinars.

These numbers and data provide hard facts for your new potential sponsors to analyze and understand the benefits of sponsoring your events.
<h3>Webinar Data</h3>
Providing data on the webinar would be a beneficial asset to you and your sponsor because it gives them quantitative data to understand the benefits to sponsoring your webinar. Potential metrics to share with your webinar sponsors are:
<ul>
 	<li>The number of audience members on your previous webinar.</li>
 	<li>The number of leads that each sponsor received in your previous webinar.</li>
 	<li>The number of return audience members in your previous webinars</li>
</ul>
<h3>Demographics</h3>
Demographics can help a sponsor decide if sponsoring your event is the right fit for them. If the audience members to your webinars are not in the target market they would be less likely to invest in sponsoring your event.

However, with the target market matching the audience in your webinars, it becomes a worthy investment for your sponsors and they may be more willing to sponsor your webinar.
<h3>Testimonials/Survey</h3>
Testimonials and survey responses from audience members also give another layer of depth for qualitative data for your potential sponsors to consider.

The surveys and audience members' testimonials can create an additional layer to the ROI you can provide to the sponsors to convince them that your webinar is the right choice for them to sponsor.
<h2>Sponsorship Packages</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16809 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/eventbank-blog-mobile@2x.png"" alt=""audience engagement"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

When asking for sponsors for your webinars, you should create different packages for different sponsors. This tiered sponsorship can help you differentiate different sponsors by giving different benefits.

The more expensive tiers can come with direct marketing and speaking opportunities from the sponsors as well as banner ads during the webinar.

The lower tiers can have a shout-out at the beginning or end of the webinar.

However, you must make it clear the prices and the benefits of each tier. You would not want your sponsors and you to have a misunderstanding because that can destroy relationships with your sponsors and destroy your reputation for other sponsors.

In addition, sponsors will only buy your packages if they are clear on what they receive when they purchase the package.

Ensure your package descriptions are clear on what the benefits and prices are.

Sponsorships for events are a common practice but because of the COVID-19 pandemic, events are no longer as widespread.

As webinars are on the rise, sponsorships on webinars will be the next trend.

Get ahead of the curve and start setting up sponsorship packages for your webinars, as these can benefit you, your sponsor, and even your audience members.
