77,"Applying Lean Startup Techniques to Grow Your Association","Associations typically move at a snail's pace. It comes from a good place. You want to make sure your programs deliver maximum value before they get off the ground. However, in the long run, it will waste your money over and over again.

But it doesn't have to be that way. Some associations have started developing at the radical pace of a lean startup and you should too. “The Lean Startup” is a methodology founded by Eric Ries. It's a way to run your company to maximize growth and minimize waste. It favors repeated experimentation over a long-term business plan. This way, a startup (or an association) can't fail by falling down the rabbit hole of a bad idea.

Some of your favorite startups (like Facebook, Youtube, and Quora) <a href=""https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-truly-successful-startups-who-used-the-lean-startup-methodology"">started lean</a> and used an experiment-driven development process. Don't let your association fall stagnant developing a plan that might not work. Instead, use the lean startup method to iterate your ideas over and over again—knowing that you'll hit gold eventually. Here's how.
<h2>The Lean Startup Cycle: Build-Measure-Learn</h2>
“<a href=""https://theleanstartup.com/principles"">The fundamental activity of a startup</a> is to turn ideas into products, measure how customers respond, and then learn whether to pivot or persevere,” Ries explains. By focusing on accelerating this cycle, startups (and associations too) don't have to waste the time or money pursuing the wrong ideas.

Ries breaks down this cycle into three easy steps: build, measure, learn. Together, the steps create a feedback loop that powers the engine of a lean startup. It works like this.
<ol>
 	<li><b>Build. </b>Create a Minimum Viable Product or an initial version of what you're offering.</li>
 	<li><b>Measure. </b>Analyze the Minimum Viable Product's success by gathering qualitative and quantitative data.</li>
 	<li><b>Learn. </b>Synthesize the data to decide a) whether the Minimum Viable Product is worth pursuing, and b) how to improve upon it if it is.</li>
</ol>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-78"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Build-Measure-Learn-1024x640.jpg"" alt=""lean startup principles for association, lean startup techniques to use for association's grow"" width=""538"" height=""336"" />

By using a short Build-Measure-Learn cycle, you can iterate over and over again. Following the cycle allows you to improve upon what you have, while collecting feedback in real-time—or scrap what you have entirely and start something new without wasting too many resources. Applying this cycle to your association will give you the room and resources to take bigger risks, and reap bigger rewards.
<h2>Build Your Association's Product</h2>
Building the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the first step in the cycle. <a href=""https://leanstack.com/"">LEANSTACK</a>, a collection of tools that assist lean startups, defines an MVP as “the smallest thing you can build that delivers customer value.”

<a href=""https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp"">According to lean startup expert Henrik Kniberg</a>, that means, that if your customers need a way to get around, you don't build them a car first. You start with a skateboard (the Minimum Viable Product), get their feedback, and iterate from there.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-79 size-full"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/mvp-scateboard.png"" alt=""minimum viable product example associations, lean startup techniques to grow association"" width=""814"" height=""137"" />

As an association, you might not think you're creating a product. But you're trying to create something that delivers value - just like a lean startup is trying to give value to their customers. Even though your product might not be tangible, or for sale on the open market, it's still a product. Career networking events provide the connections you need to get ahead, professional development sessions provide opportunities to expand your career, humanitarian initiatives provide a service to those in need.

It's important to create a Minimum Viable Product for these kinds of programs so that you're asking the question “Should we do this?” rather than “Can we do this?” You shouldn't spend months planning a career development series for your members only to have no one show up because they've already learned the skills you're offering. Throwing together an MVP is the best way to know if you've made something your members want, or if you're wasting your time.
<h3>Real Example: How to Build Minimum Viable Product</h3>
<img class="" wp-image-82 alignleft"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/NCARB-logo.png"" alt=""National Council of Architectural Registration Boards logo"" width=""266"" height=""102"" />

The National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB) spent six months working with a user interface consultant on their new online reporting system—and three years after deployment, <a href=""https://getmespark.com/wp-content/uploads/LeanStartup.pdf"">less than 2% of their customers</a> use the system. They wasted tons of resources on a system that no one needed. A project like this makes them the poster child for needing to adopt lean methods.

Recently, the NCARB made an MVP for a real-time contact feature on its site. The prototype was clunky. When a site visitor wanted to contact their association, a staffer would get an email that let them know to call the site visitor. Even though this wasn't a sustainable prototype, it tested the waters to see if members <i>actually wanted </i>to use the feature—and they did!
<h3>Tools to Help You Grow Your Association</h3>
Throwing together an MVP can be hectic and new for associations. Here are some tools to help you accomplish it.
<ul>
 	<li><b><a href=""https://www.teamwork.com/"">Teamwork Projects</a> </b>When you're throwing together a program, it's important to make sure everything you've planned actually gets done. A project management software app like Teamwork Projects can help your team keep track of each task and who's responsible for what. The Teamwork productivity suite also has a live chat function, so you don't have to call a meeting every time you want to make a decision.</li>
 	<li><b><a href=""https://www.huddle.com/product/services/"">Huddle</a> </b>Cloud storage products like Huddle keep everyone's work accessible—so you'll never be out of the loop. Huddle combines file sharing, collaboration, and project management so that you can get to (and edit) every document or project at the push of a button.</li>
 	<li><strong><a href=""https://www.eventbank.cn/solutions/association-chamber-management-cloud"">Association &amp; Chamber Management Cloud</a> </strong>This management tool from EventBank helps you increase your team's efficiency by integrating project management tools with CRM, email marketing, event and membership management. What's best, everything is connected, so you have all your data in one place.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Measure if Your Association's Product Is Working</h2>
The measurement process, the second part of the Build-Measure-Learn cycle, tests the effectiveness of your MVP. <a href=""https://steveblank.com/2015/05/06/build-measure-learn-throw-things-against-the-wall-and-see-if-they-work/"">Your MVP is a hypothesis</a>. You think your customers or members need something and the measurement step analyzes whether or not that hypothesis is correct.

Once you have an MVP it's easy to get excited about what you've created and experience <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=confirmation+bias&amp;oq=confirmation+bias&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.7511j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"">confirmation bias</a>, but rigorous analysis will prevent your team from going down the rabbit hole of executing a program without a good reason. In the measurement step, you collect qualitative and quantitative data about your initiatives.

For an association, that could be a number of opened emails for your marketing initiative, attendees at your networking event, or member feedback for a service program.

By doing a rigorous analysis for each of your MVPs, you can make sure you're getting an honest and true assessment of what you need to improve. <a href=""https://theleanstartup.com/principles"">As Eric Ries says</a>, whether to “pivot or persevere.”   Real Example: How the IEEE Uses Feedback and Data Analysis
<h3>Real Example: How the IEEE Uses Feedback and Data Analysis</h3>
<img class=""size-medium wp-image-83 alignleft"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Logo-IEEE-300x97.png"" alt=""The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers logo"" />

The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) tested an MVP of their <a href=""https://blended-learning.ieee.org/VLSI/Dashboard.aspx"">Blended Learning</a> project, to see if there was a need for educating engineers in India. They used primary and secondary research to develop an MVP for their educational program and met to discuss how to execute their plan. “We had literally hundreds of post-its with data points on the wall,” Karen Hawkins, Senior Director of Product Design, said.

Once they had validated their MVP, they found local partners in India and created a soft launch of their educational program. They then invited students and faculty in Bangalore to take their courses and offer their feedback, before they officially launched.

Analyzing your progress using feedback and data is helpful to check your progress and make sure you're headed in the right direction at every stage. The quick cycle of the lean startup method lets you do so in real time. But measuring and learning from your programs is certainly different from measuring the success of an app.
<h3>Ways to Apply Analysis to Your Association</h3>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Website analytics. </b>Analyzing who's coming to your website (and out of those visitors, who's signing up for your programs) can be helpful. This way you can see if your programs or marketing materials are connecting with your visitors. Tools like <a href=""https://amplitude.com/mobile-analytics"">Amplitude</a> can break down the results into easy-to-interpret graphics. So you don't have to be a data scientist to understand them.</li>
 	<li><b>Feedback surveys. </b>Getting feedback from members who attended a Minimum Viable Program through a survey tool like <a href=""https://qualaroo.com/"">Qualaroo</a> or <a href=""https://www.surveymonkey.com/"">SurveyMonkey</a> is key to knowing what you can improve on next time. This qualitative data allows you to answer specific questions you might have, and even acquire feedback in your members' own words.</li>
 	<li><b>Event management software. </b>Event management software can track who signed up for your event, and who showed up. Tools like EventBank's <a href=""https://www.eventbank.com/solutions/event-marketing-management-cloud"">Event Marketing Cloud</a> allow you to track engagement for individual members, and send out a personalized targeted promotion. By tracking these efforts, you can look at long-term data to see if your initiatives are working.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Learn Whether to Expand or Cut Your Product...</h2>
The third stage of the cycle, learning, is when you implement your findings. No matter what happens—whether you trash or expand your Minimum Viable Product. You've taken a step forward in knowing what your members need. Even if your initiative was a complete failure, remember that it's better to fail fast and get right back up again. When your MVP fails, it fails without wasting too many resources. And when it succeeds, you've got the feedback to know what to do better next time.

The lean startup techniques to grow association are a cycle, which is exactly why they work. The cyclical nature of the lean startup method should be exciting rather than be discouraging. At the beginning of every cycle, you've got a low-risk opportunity to revolutionize your association.",,2017-04-12,post,http://blog.eventbank.com/applying-lean-startup-techniques-growing-association/,http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/email.jpg|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Build-Measure-Learn.jpg|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/mvp-scateboard.png|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/NCARB-logo.png|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Logo-IEEE.png,"email|Build Measure and Learn, Startup Principles for Association|Minimum Viable Product Example Association|NCARB logo|Logo IEEE",||||,||||,"lean startup techniques for events|lean startup principles for association|minimum viable product example associations|National Council of Architectural Registration Boards logo|The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers logo",http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/email.jpg,,"Associations &amp; Chambers","association management",English,,publish,2,oliver.lompart,oliver.lompart@eventbank.com,Oliver,Lompart,applying-lean-startup-techniques-growing-association,,,0,0,0,open,open,2020-02-25
99,"Building Communities and Seizing the Entrepreneurial Spirit in China","Almost fifteen years ago, I started my lifelong journey as an entrepreneur. With my newly-minted degrees, I arrived in China ready for the thrill of entrepreneurship. Knowing I could add value to the world with my tenacity, creativity, and ambition was exciting. The Chinese economy was growing tremendously and the idea of starting my own business was exhilarating. Opportunities for local and international businessmen and women were abound.

However, I soon found that establishing my first company was no walk in the park. It took a tremendous amount of effort and a lot of optimism to keep my business from going under. From establishing and financing my new company without any savings or immediate customers to finding and keeping clients, my foray into entrepreneurship was challenging. Starting the company was difficult to say the least.
<h2>Starting Building Communities in China</h2>
As a result of the many obstacles, I used my moments of free time to create a professional network that could help international entrepreneurs improve their business operations, share experiences, and exchange information about trends affecting their respective start-up businesses. Over the years, this small network, known as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/groups/1841615/profilehttps://www.linkedin.com/company/501676?trk=tyah&amp;trkInfo=tarId%3A1479713771640%2Ctas%3Achina%20entre%2Cidx%3A3-1-6"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">China Entrepreneurs</a>, grew immensely. What started as small monthly gatherings of 20 to 30 people turned into a professional organization comprised of over 20,000 Chinese and international members.

Though as we hosted more and more events—upwards of 100 per year—we found ourselves in overdrive. Coordination became nightmarish and increasingly laborious: logistics were messy, internal and external communications were strenuous, and revenue tracking was spread across multiple computers and an assortment of software programs.

But we realized we weren’t the only ones facing these challenges. Thousands of for-profit and non-profit communities were facing similar issues. We all were either falling behind the ever-increasing pace of technological change, or simply could not afford the technology that would solve our problems.
<blockquote>""We realized we weren't the only ones facing these challenges.""</blockquote>
Around the world, billions of people and organizations don’t have their desired technological agility to achieve their goals. Connecting to the internet from anywhere and organizing information in an efficient, useful manner is a far-fetched option for many. Communities are also discovering they need to facilitate better communication to keep their organizations engaged. As a result, these desires to keep up with the pace of technological change, acquire affordable, cutting-edge technology, and harness innovative tools that strengthen people’s relationships within and between communities quickly became evident.
<h2>From Building Community to Building a Company</h2>
So with all of this in mind, the idea for a new company came to light. EventBank, <a href=""https://www.eventbank.com/about/company"">a cloud-based engagement management software company</a>. Founded to help all professional communities share resources and create opportunities for success by moving community information to where it optimally belongs—in the cloud and at the heart of effective decision making. Now, three and half years since our product development began, we are transforming the way professional communities enable and enrich relationships. Hundreds of communities are exchanging information and utilizing more effective means of communication toward achieving their goals. They are increasing their efficiency, reducing costs, and driving value with our technology.

In the midst of this growing success, the thrill of being an entrepreneur after 15 years has not faded. Evangelist and entrepreneur Guy Kawasaki once said, “The best reason to start an organization is to make meaning. To create a product or service to make the world a better place.” Embodying this entrepreneurial spirit is <a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/eventbank-story/smart-recruiting-practices-helped-eventbank-grow/"">why we continue innovating</a> and building customer-centric solutions at EventBank. We will continue embracing our ambitions, fostering our creativity, and harnessing our tenacity to catalyze positive change for communities around the globe.

121,"How to Make Millennials a Key Part of Your Association","Millennials will represent <a href=""https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/managing-tomorrows-people/future-of-work/assets/reshaping-the-workplace.pdf"">half of the US workforce</a> by 2020, and grow to 75% of the world's workforce by 2030. While your association might be thriving full of Generation X-ers right now, those days are numbered. Therefore it is time to ask how to make millennials a key part of your association.
<blockquote>If you don't create a millennial membership base, your association is a ticking time bomb.</blockquote>
But millennials are fundamentally different from previous generations, which is why it's a challenge to get them involved. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/04/millennials-see-themselves-as-greedy-self-absorbed-and-wasteful-study-finds"">59% of millennials</a> describe their generation as self-absorbed, in comparison to only 30% of Gen X.

It might seem that this would make millennials stay far away from associations (why would they want to join a group when they only care about themselves?), but it actually makes them ideal members. Here's why.
<h2>Millennials <i>should </i>love your association</h2>
When a Generation X-er thinks about their first job, they might think about trying to climb the company's corporate ladder, but a new study from LinkedIn shows that <a href=""https://blog.linkedin.com/2016/04/12/will-this-year_s-college-grads-job-hop-more-than-previous-grads"">millennials average 4 job changes by the time they're 30.</a>

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-124 "" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/linkedin-study-1024x684.jpg"" alt=""linkedin study on college graduates shifting jobs"" width=""635"" height=""424"" />
Because they might not be sticking around at one company for long, joining an association is the ideal way to network, build skills, and carve the path they think is right for them. Millennials love to invest in themselves.
<blockquote><a href=""https://www.millennialmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Maximizing-Millennials-IG-1.jpg"">65% of millennials</a> said that personal development is the most important factor at their current job, and your association offers those services. It's a natural fit.</blockquote>
For example, a corporate lawyer who wants to enter public service would have a hard time finding a new job—most of his connections are at his current firm. It's hard to get a public service job without a personal relationship, but the New York Bar Association could help him expand his network. The association also offers professional development workshops, like “How to Become an Assistant District Attorney,” which could at least set him on the right track to make the shift.
<h2>Marketing: Meet millennials on their turf</h2>
Social media has already beaten out the email as <a href=""https://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/17-statistics-show-social-media-future-customer-service"">the top Internet activity</a>, and our time spent on it is only increasing. Millennials use it even more. Millennial social networkers <a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/248087/time-spent-on-leading-us-social-networking-sites-via-mobile-apps/"">spend an average</a> of 25 hours per month on Facebook—and that's only on mobile devices. Because of its prevalence, social media has become a primary source of communication for friends, family, and advertisers alike.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-125"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/statistic_id248087_us-millennials_-time-spent-on-social-apps-2015.png"" alt=""How much time do millennials spend on social media?, How to Make Millennials a Key Part of Your Association"" width=""584"" height=""434"" />

But learning to use social media for outreach should be helpful, not frustrating. It actually gives you more chances to talk to your potential members. If you meet millennials on their turf, you have an opportunity to tell them<i> why </i>your association can help them.

Making a Facebook group is one way to market your association over social media. It's not a commitment for anyone to join, so it's an opportunity for you to connect to potential members. When you post an update to a Facebook group, like an event your association is holding, people automatically get the notification delivered right to their phones. From there, they can comment and engage—in an app they're already constantly using.
<h2>Recruiting: Don't push too hard</h2>
On the internet, millennials are bombarded with choices about how to spend their time. When they're scrolling through their Twitter feeds, they can click on a <i>New York Times</i> article, another video of cute puppies, or your association's advertisement. The bar is higher for grabbing their attention.

But in a <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2015/02/24/388592666/how-do-you-market-to-millennials"">focus group in Southern California</a>, there was one thing millennials truly hated: when marketers tried <i>too</i> hard to get their attention. One participant requested, “Entertain me, make me happy, capture my attention, speak to my conscious and then leave me the heck alone.""
<h2>Engage: Make Millennials a Key Part of Your Association</h2>
It's not enough just to develop a social media presence. You can't just broadcast information, you have to engage. People don't want to feel like they're being bombarded with spam. They want to see the human side of your association. When someone comments that they're interested in something, reply. <a href=""https://www.eventbank.com/solutions/event-marketing-management-cloud"">Create an event</a> so that other members can see who's attending. So they can see who they know, and who they might meet.

For example, Facebook groups are community-driven. Members can invite each other to events such as after-work networking cocktail. The engagement comes from the bottom up, instead of from some nebulous marketers.
<h2>Finally, Engaging: How to keep your members involved</h2>
<a href=""https://fortune.com/2015/03/26/3-things-millennials-want-in-a-career-hint-its-not-more-money/"">75% of millennials</a> feel that their employers could put more focus on inspiring and developing future leaders. Millennials want to become those leaders, and they don't think their employers are teaching them well enough. They need associations like yours to do it.

You know why your unique association is valuable to its members. You know your mission, and you know your success stories. Millennials want the same kind of success. Once you get them to join, keeping them engaged is about keeping them informed on what you offer. Now you know that there are new communication channels you need to use to do so.

Millennials want you to help them become our future leaders. Come 2030, your industry will be thanking you.

133,"Smart Recruiting Practices that Helped EventBank Grow","Earlier this year, we celebrated our four-year anniversary. It wasn’t easy getting to this milestone, but I’m proud we have been able to build innovative products. Recently we were nominated by NOVA’s <a href=""https://www.novachamber.org/innovation-awards.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">2017 Greater Washington Innovation Awards</a>, opened offices around the world, and have developed a customer base that relies on our company daily. However, what I am most proud of is the group of people that work at our company today.

There are many books about building a team and creating company culture, but actually following through is another story. As startup companies grow, they must continually source great hires to ensure highly productive teams. At EventBank, we’ve established some strong recruiting practices that have helped our company develop into the successful team we are today.
<h2>Smart Recruiting Practices from EventBank</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>
<h4><strong>Fuel growth with diversity.</strong></h4>
We believe people of different cultures and backgrounds bring different interpretations of events and innovative methods of problem solving. Our 70-person team comes from 16 different countries. This range of backgrounds helps us generate innovative ideas, boost problem solving, and increase our team’s creativity. Diversity allows us to create products that better serve cultures and clients around the world.</li>
 	<li>
<h4><strong>Hire for experience.</strong></h4>
Experienced hires have been key to moving our company forward. People who maintain industry knowledge and experience can take a problem and create a solution that’s better than anything we had before. These individuals often use hindsight to conduct important decision making; they foresee, avoid, and reduce potential <a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/ceos-insights/building-communities-china-entrepreneurs/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">bumps in the road</a>. Finding the right mix of experience and competencies is essential for navigating complex roles and market environments.</li>
 	<li>
<h4><strong>Find people who want to “do”.</strong></h4>
Because we are a fast-paced company, seeking hires who have a strong, hardworking spirit is vital. Self-motivators who thrive on pressure often work faster and smarter than their counterparts. These individuals accomplish tasks not just to meet their supervisor’s expectations, they work to exceed them. Not only this, hires must have an instinctive nature to solve problems outside of their regular workload. Sourcing as many of these “doers” as possible is critical to sustaining long-term company growth.</li>
 	<li>
<h4><strong>Embrace and curate your culture</strong>.</h4>
Company culture, made up of employees’ values, practices, assumptions, and beliefs, evolves over time. As EventBank has grown, our culture has moved in unanticipated, yet rewarding ways. We have gradually turned into a <a href=""https://www.eventbank.com/company/about#values"">focused, solution-driven company that heavily relies on employee collaboration</a>. We have embraced this sense of forward-driven teamwork and finding people who match this culture has been critical to creating an environment that enables our natural company identity and shared pursuits.</li>
 	<li>
<h4><strong>Pinpoint passion.</strong></h4>
Getting to know prospective hires during the interview process is crucial to determining whether a candidate is good fit. This involves taking time to learn a candidate’s motivations for wanting the job. Understand the candidate’s long-term goals, career track record, and reasoning why he or she has chosen this particular line of work. It’s only after doing so that you can really start to grasp whether your candidate has a passion to succeed.</li>
</ol>

<h3></h3>
<h3>Sourcing Right People Pays Off</h3>

151,"How To Select Management Technology For Your Association","When you run a large association, with chapters and members all over the country, your list of tasks is never-ending. There is a big amount of things to do: signing up new members, collecting dues, tracking finances and planning events.
<h2><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Event Management Technology for Associations</strong></span></h2>
It's tempting to have a powerful specialized tool to cover each of your different tasks. Marketo for marketing, Salesforce for lead generation, EventBrite for event management, and on and on. The problem is none of these tools are geared towards associations. They don't know how you operate and their solutions are made for companies.

Instead of having different specialized software, you can try <a href=""https://www.eventbank.com/solutions/association-chamber-management-cloud"">a single event management technology for associations</a> that keeps all your tools together. Here's why.

Already hooked on getting event management technology? Book a demo to see more for yourself with EventBank's event management software solution.

<h2><span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">All-in-One Software Makes Your Data More Efficient</span></strong></span></h2>
Your data lives in a feedback loop - information about finances and membership affects areas of your work beyond money and sign-ups.

If you're planning a huge gala event and inviting all your members, you need to know about their behavior. It would be very useful in planning the event, to market effectively, and sell more tickets. With event management technology for associations your membership CRM works together with your event management tool.

While planning the event, you can use your membership CRM to learn details like:

<img class="" wp-image-171 alignright"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/helloquence-61189-300x200.jpg"" alt=""event management technology for associations"" width=""317"" height=""211"" />
<ul>
 	<li>The number of people who came to your last similar event</li>
 	<li>What percentage of your members buy early-bird tickets</li>
 	<li>Response rates to social media vs. email campaigns</li>
</ul>
Later, your event management tool has to combine all these positions. If you use two separate tools for your membership CRM and event planning, you will have to manually input and merge data between them. It can be not only waste of time but also exhausting and boring process.

When you have an all-in-one tool which puts your membership CRM alongside your event management, it will let you focus on maximizing attendance at your events and catering to your members.
<h2><span style=""font-size: 14pt; color: #000000;""><strong>Multi-Tenant Control Streamlines Internal Communication</strong></span></h2>
For your gala event, you'll be calling on various chapters, leaders, and members to help you plan. In this case, to plan the event they will need to access all your critical information. However, multi-tenant control is viable only when you use a single all-in-one event management technology for associations.

Multi-tenant control streamlines intra-association communication by providing different users access to information and sometimes cloud-based remote access. If your association's tech stack includes a range of tools, offering access to each one individually can become cumbersome. When all the information is centralized, multi-tenant control can make planning even more efficient.

By using multi-tenant control for your gala event:
<ul>
 	<li>The treasurer can quickly pull up the finances for your association's previous large events held around the country.</li>
 	<li>You have an opportunity to divide tasks among event planners within the association and everyone can see the results.</li>
 	<li>You can share, adapt for different regions, and track your standardized marketing materials from one place.</li>
</ul>
<img class=""wp-image-174 alignleft"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/tycho-atsma-181053-300x200.jpg"" alt=""event management technology for associations"" width=""350"" height=""233"" />Within large associations, there is almost always a long chain of command and control is spread over various chapters and members. It can be difficult to get everyone on the same page.

Multi-tenant control allows individual users access to different things: financial records, membership CRM, events management tool, marketing materials and results. Many all-in-one tools provide customization options too, so you can determine who gets permission to access what.
<h2><span style=""font-size: 14pt; color: #000000;""><strong>Customer Support Becomes Faster and More Useful</strong></span></h2>
Regardless of the features your association management tech comes with, excellent customer support remains paramount. If you spread the tasks out across a range of tools, though, you will have to do email followups with half a dozen representatives rather than just one.

With an all-in-one product, customer support can help you through every corner of your association management rather than just focusing on what could be just one issue you have in a laundry list of problems.

If you're making final touches on your gala, running into an issue with your software can be disastrous—you have salespersons and members all depending on everything going off without a hitch. As a result, you're going to need customer support that replies promptly and, ideally, over a range of mediums.

Email support and online messaging with customer service are becoming increasingly common on major sites. But large associations, for the most part, prefer phone service.

According to Help Scout, speaking directly with a real person not only improves the сustomer support process but can also <a href=""https://www.helpscout.net/75-customer-service-facts-quotes-statistics/"">deliver better answers and actual support</a>.

Having a customer support agent who is <a href=""https://www.eventbank.com/company/contact/"">available by phone 24/7</a> is invaluable for your association.

Also, by utilizing a single all-in-one event management technology for associations, you will have to go only through one training. You don't have to go through on-boarding for eight different types of software. This means you can learn how to use your tool faster and get straight into managing your association.
<h2><span style=""font-size: 14pt; color: #000000;""><strong>All-in-One Management Tool Does Everything Faster</strong></span></h2>
The option of building a tech stack can help you to make make managing of your association easier. When you choose a variety of tools over an all-in-one piece of software like <em>EventBank</em>, you decentralize your information and make management harder for yourself.

<a href=""https://www.eventbank.com/solutions/event-marketing-management-cloud"">An all-in-one event management technology</a> will keep everything from your membership CRM to your sales and marketing all in one place. This will let every leader in your association have an easier time accessing crucial data and will keep various aspects of your planning in conversation with each other.

Paired with excellent customer support, your streamlined and faster tech stack will ensure your association runs efficiently.

209,"Embracing Bumps in the Road is Just Part of an Entrepreneur's Journey","As an entrepreneur, coming across bumps in the road is just part of building a business. When you are sick, managing an overflowing inbox, overwhelmed with more sales calls to make, and have unexpected crises popping up every which way, it’s easy to think you should give up. Sometimes life just throws things at you that you’d never expect. Having the courage to take on big endeavors and push through tough times is critical to building your business. Embracing the bumps in the road and getting up after falling is essential to keeping things on track. Pushing through leads to the most rewarding and satisfying experiences. It’s that light at the end of the tunnel.
<blockquote><em>“Pushing through leads to the most rewarding and satisfying experiences.”</em></blockquote>
A few weeks ago, a terrific group of entrepreneurship students from Medgar Evers College in New York City toured <a href=""https://www.eventbank.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">EventBank</a>’s China office in Beijing. We had a great time discussing Chinese business culture, building a business in Asia, as well as what it’s like to be a lifelong entrepreneur. Their visit inspired me to share some of the messages that I gave to them about my entrepreneurial journey and how I move through challenges toward achieving my goals. Especially one experience that I will forever treasure.
<h3>Start of Entrepreneur's Journey After the Graduation</h3>
Just out of grad school at Rensselear Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, NY, I moved to Beijing to start my own business at the suggestion of one of my business professors. In 2002, being a foreign entrepreneur in China was not especially common. Once on the ground establishing connections with other like-minded entrepreneurs was essential for getting my first business going.

Founding China Entrepreneurs in 2003 was a real highlight during this time. However, despite my newfound business relationships, my entrepreneurial life wasn’t starting off like the way I always imagined. I had some successes—navigating my business through the 2003 SARS epidemic for one—but I also made a lot of mistakes as any 22 year old without business experience would in a market that has its unique set of challenges. So, I was on the lookout for new opportunities.

As this desire to do something different came to fruition, a friend approached me with an invitation to travel the Silk Road as Marco Polo did. He told me he and a group of people were going to travel from Beijing to Venice by bicycle. I thought, “Whoa! This was travel—no, adventure!” We assembled a team of seven cyclists with a plan to retrace Marco Polo’s journey across Asia. Our team spent 12 to 15 hours a day sketching our route and laying out logistics in the run up to our expedition. After countless efforts procuring sponsorships, and trainings for what would become an adventure of a lifetime, our aspirations became reality on September 7, 2004.
<h3>Pushing Through Alone</h3>
Once we departed Beijing, during the first part of our trip, my knees ached non-stop, my entire body was sore from this experience that you can’t really train for and pushing through the pain became a mind game. But, the team started to disassemble for various reasons and thirty days in, my last cycling companions and I parted ways. I cycled alone for the next seventy days.

Cycling alone was hard work, but also getting up with the sun became a habit. Telling myself I had to get back on the bike for another grueling day of cycling was tough, but exciting. Each day required riding for eight to nine hours a day, oftentimes through treacherous terrain and even more treacherous weather—windstorms, sandstorms, blizzards, and torrential downpours. But, each new day brought new experiences, whether it was great food, great people, or just some amazing historical sites that I may never see again.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-212 size-full"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bike.jpg"" alt=""entrepreneurs journey, cycling alone through the bumps, Marco Polo’s journey across Asia"" width=""744"" height=""400"" />
<div class=""slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width"" data-imgsrc=""https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAigAAAAJDMyNmE2OTk5LWM5N2YtNDYwOS1hNDU4LTA4MzM4MGYwY2M0Zg.jpg""></div>
<h3>When the First Difficulties Arise</h3>
It wasn’t until I was in Central Asia that I faced my first major challenge. After days of dirt roads and potholes, I came to the border between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Upon arrival, I learned the border crossing was closed to international citizens for an undetermined amount of time at the suggestion of our President George W. Bush to prevent terrorists from crossing the main border bridge (so, I was told).

Frustrated, I turned around and started my journey north—100 additional kilometers more to go. After just one kilometer into my detour, a group of military soldiers with AK-47s stopped me and searched everything I had. They made me unpack my belongings, went through all the pictures on my camera, and confiscated my winter pants. Without knowing any Tajik or Russian it was next to impossible to figure out why the border officials took my winter pants. But I could guess someone was cold!
<h3>In the Midst of the Disarray</h3>
Shortly after I continued on my way, however, it started raining. And within minutes, it was pouring. Torn up roads, potholes, rocks, mud—kilometer after kilometer became draining. Though in the midst of this disarray, I passed by a beautiful, quaint farm on the right-hand side of the road. I began to slow down as I saw a dog running toward me. I soon realized not only was it running toward me, it was barking—running at me full speed. Chasing me as if I was red meat! The rain, the mud, the rocks, the potholes, and now this crazy dog. The next thing I know I’m two feet down in a ditch. My bike toppled over, my gear shifter broken, and now a dispirited owner of a new one-speed bike. Utterly drenched and covered in mud, getting back on the bicycle seat was my only option.

It took some serious time to get back up after that fall. And riding on, it was difficult to stay positive. I knew I had people relying on me to complete my journey. I had sponsors (Nike, Philips, MapInfo, and others), I had a family, and I had friends who all put their confidence in me to achieve what I said I would achieve. I had to get up. I had to keep moving forward.
<h3>Good People Along the Way</h3>
Later that day, I came to a tiny town and parked myself under a bus stop canopy. A couple people walked by, staring at me, curious what I was doing there. Then ten minutes later, one of them came back, he approached me and put an entire bushel of grapes in my lap. He didn’t know who I was, why I was there, and didn’t speak a word of English. Immediately, my day turned around as a result of this act of kindness.

Within minutes, a crowd had gathered. An English-speaking university student who on break from school was found in town by the others. He began translating my conversation with the crowd and started asking me questions about my journey. After no more than a half an hour, he insisted that I join him and his family for dinner. He hosted me overnight after what had been one of the worst days of my journey.
<blockquote>“I had to keep moving forward.”</blockquote>
I found kindness in the most unexpected of places along this entire journey—kindness that helped me get out of my own thoughts and change the way I think and act on an everyday level. I reflected on my challenges and learned what it meant to power through overwhelming physical and mental fatigue. As a budding entrepreneur, I powered through tough times and had a lot of potential to capitalize on my strengths. I learned I had the stamina to make it no matter what obstacles come my way. I could trust that I would meet all kinds of people who would be there to support me. Even if I wasn’t expecting it.

<h3>Continuing the Journey as an Entrepreneur</h3>
Seventeen countries and one hundred days later from the start in Beijing, on December 14, 2004, I was met in the morning by members of Pedale Veneziano—the oldest cycling club in Italy for the final ride to Venice. We arrived into San Marco Square like Marco Polo had left, on a boat. The sense of accomplishment after completing my journey was tremendous. I still appreciate everyone that helped me along the way. And knowing I had outwitted myself was beyond gratifying. Given half a chance, I would do my trip all over again. Now, 12 years later this month, I’m proud to be on the journey of <a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/ceos-insights/building-communities-china-entrepreneurs/"">building EventBank</a>. Working with our great team of talented individuals as we move towards our own “Venice”.

234,"Virtual Reality Hacks for Your Next Event & Why it Attracts Attendees","Virtual reality, or VR, isn't just science fiction anymore. It's a reality. It's predicted that there will be <a href=""//www.statista.com/statistics/426469/active-virtual-reality-users-worldwide/"">171 million active users</a> in 2018, compared to 43 million in 2016. The hype around VR already exists, and it's<i> </i><a href=""//venturebeat.com/2016/06/21/vr-report-says-consumer-interest-in-virtual-reality-goes-far-beyond-games/"">growing <i>fast</i></a>.

Want to get VR to your event? Check out our <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/event-vr-guide/"">VR for Events Guide</a>!
<h3>The Future of Virtual Reality at Events</h3>
VR isn't just for video games—it can replicate an environment. It can put you in the Amazon Rainforest or on Mars so that you feel like you are somewhere else. This makes it a goldmine of opportunities for your organization's events.

While most people still think VR is a luxury of the distant future and not a business tool, in reality, it's becoming <a href=""//www.fool.com/investing/2016/06/06/12-virtual-reality-stats-that-will-blow-you-away.aspx"">cheaper and easier to use every year</a>. Google Cardboard goes for as little as $15 now, and advanced VR like the Oculus Rift are <a href=""//www3.oculus.com/en-us/blog/introducing-vr-for-good-inspiring-social-change-through-the-power-of-vr/"">developing programs for nonprofits</a>. VR Developers are even making custom gear for corporates to use in event spaces, providing showroom-floor booths tailor-made for 3D modeling in virtual, so attendees can walk around a 3D model of a car manufacturer's proof of concept models.

Even at the Event Organizer level, Virtual is here to help. It draws a crowd, it makes people interested and wanting to talk to you.

Rather than seeing your next event full of awkward check-ins and pitches for fundraising, fill it with excited members buzzing over wearing 3D VR headsets. Here are three ways to take advantage of VR at your events.
<h2>1. Share your mission</h2>
[caption id=""attachment_239"" align=""alignright"" width=""250""]<img class=""wp-image-239"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/use-virtual-reality-at-your-event-200x300.jpg"" alt=""use virtual reality at your event"" width=""250"" height=""375"" /> Immersed in virtual reality © Samuel Zeller[/caption]

VR provides a unique and impactful way to share your mission and what your organization has been working on by literally (well, virtually) immersing folks in it. You should create space at events where you can use VR to share your work.

For instance, if you're a chamber of commerce and have been working to build the next generation of community business leaders in public schools, you can <i>show</i> members exactly what you've been doing. VR will bring attendees directly inside the classroom so they can see the kids interact and participate.

<a href=""//www.adweek.com/digital/how-virtual-reality-inspiring-donors-dig-deep-charitable-causes-171641/"">Charity: Water</a>, for example, used the Samsung Gear headsets at a gala event in the MET to tell the story of a young girl in Ethiopia getting clean water for her and her family for the first time ever. The video replicates a setting in Ethiopia. This way the attendees can look around and feel like they were part of the experience.

The video was so effective that they raised <b>over $2.4 million dollars</b>, far exceeding the charity's expectations. But sharing your mission through VR isn't just effective for fundraising. Lead members through a VR tour of a new business in your chamber of commerce community. Or, use it at recruitment events to demonstrate why people should join your organization. You can bring VR to any membership event to show the great work you're doing.
<h2>2. Cut across geographical barriers</h2>
VR renders the disadvantages of geographical separation meaningless. Video chat made this true for meetings, but VR is making this true for events so that people unable to attend can walk around and talk to other attendees.

[caption id=""attachment_236"" align=""alignleft"" width=""250""]<img class=""wp-image-236"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/virtual-reality-169x300.jpeg"" alt=""the future of virtual reality at events and work"" width=""250"" height=""443"" /> Using VR to attend company meetings? It is possible. ©FinancialForce[/caption]

Picture that you have your annual celebration coming up and tons of new and old members are going to be there, but the president of your organization is out of town. A video chat would arrest them in one location—they wouldn't be able to walk or even look around or join individual conversations. With VR, suddenly, their absence doesn't mean they can't be present.

Double Robotics created a remote control robot with an iPad as the face so that physical and remote attendees can interact <a href=""//vimeo.com/77635926"">face to face</a>.

In this case, CEO Jeremy Roche of FinancialForce uses VR to attend company meetings.

Not only will a floating head roaming around your event be eye-grabbing, but when attendees find out that high-level executives put in the extra effort to be present, they'll be very appreciative.
<h2>3. Provide a fun experience</h2>
Having VR at your event doesn't even have to have a purpose other than showing your guests an amazing time. You can set up a booth where attendees can play a video game, go on a virtual scavenger hunt, or complete a virtual obstacle course.

Energy Upgrade California recently used technology by <a href=""//heliosinteractive.com/project/virtualhangglider/"">Helios Interactive</a> to create a virtual hang glider. Users wore a headset and sat on a bike. Pedaling controlled their velocity and altitude and as they soared over California. The experience also provided the dual effect of showing them their individual energy impact.

While gliding over the redwoods and valleys and cities of California, participants were asked several questions about their energy usage, which they answered via movement on the bike. The answer to the question would trigger an action on the land. For example, how you answer the question in the image “Do you open your blinds at home?” could cause a small forest fire below.

Attendees had a totally fun, yet educational experience and they were actually more likely to <a href=""//www.eventmanagerblog.com/virtual-reality-in-events/"">remember the information</a> they learned in simulation than if they were just being told.

[caption id=""attachment_238"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""594""]<img class=""wp-image-238 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/EUC_6.jpg"" alt=""Gamification of events for maximum attendee experience"" width=""594"" height=""334"" /> Gamify your events for maximum attendee experience ©ADWEEK[/caption]

Having a fun VR project can have as little or as much to do with your organization as you want. Sixty percent of people <a href=""//blog.accessdevelopment.com/customer-loyalty-statistics-2016-edition"">list fun as an important loyalty factor</a> when it comes to sticking around. If members are having a great time, they are going to remember and return to future events.
<h2>Make Virtual Reality Your Reality</h2>
Virtual reality can never replace the value of face to face <a href=""//www.eventbank.com/platform/event-manag"">engagement at your events</a>. Rather, it's an opportunity to supplement and enhance events in a way that will build excitement and loyalty to your organization.

The beauty right now is that there are no wrong answers. It's still the perfect time to experiment with virtual reality. The sooner you get started, the sooner you can be <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/associations-chambers/event-management-technology-associations/"">a pioneer in the technology</a>. No matter you're a chamber of commerce, an association, or other nonprofit. Members and non-members alike are going to be excited that you're trying something new.

VR will make your events fun and memorable, and most of all, it will <strong><a href=""//www.shadowfactory.io/blog/using-vr-at-an-event-to-stand-out"">make your events stand out</a></strong>. People will return, spread the word, and ultimately become even better members.

257,"10 Things to Have in Your Mobile Marketing Event Planning Checklist","For marketers planning an event, mobile marketing is everything. According to <a href=""//www.eventmanagerblog.com/event-app-bible/?utm_source=EMblog&amp;utm_medium=Post%20announcement&amp;utm_campaign=Post%20Announcement"">the Event App Bible</a>, 60% of smartphone users use their devices at events and social gatherings. They expect to interact not only with what happens at the event but also with mobile content and tools. As a result, marketers should employ a range of mobile channels at before, during, and after the event to boost engagement. That's why we have put together few things to have on mobile marketing event planning checklist.

SaaStr's annual conference is one of the jewels of the tech conference season. In the run up to each of their conferences, SaaStr posts a series of blog posts about how to maximize the networking and learning potential for each event. They also wheel out a brand new update for their SaaStr Events mobile app. The event app gives users an expansive photo gallery and activity feed to look at for past and future events.

In short, SaaStr not only engages mobile users, but in doing so they are actively growing their events year over year.

We've listed 10 separate things mobile marketers should include in their arsenal to ensure they cover every base of their events.
<h2>A Marketing Event Before the Event</h2>
The lead up to the event is a crucial battleground for marketing. It's during this time that you reach potential attendees through careful advertising and sell them tickets.

You need to also begin interacting with them through useful apps and their preferred social media channels so they know how to maximize their time at the event. If they have questions about the schedule or need directions to the venue, this is the time to clarify the details.

<h3>1. Make Social Media Ads</h3>
Instagram and Facebook see millions of daily mobile users. You can target advertising for your event strategically via both of these channels to people who are likely to attend. Instagram has even rolled out its picture carousel feature, which shows multiple photos in one post, specifically for corporate use. You can also add a Call to Action button on both your Facebook and Instagram posts, letting you push for more direct ticket sales.

AdEspresso has hundreds of examples of Instagram ads you can flip through to help plan your own. They can also help you plan your ads and track the analytics for them. Facebook is also a crucial place to plan targeted advertising and sell tickets. You can browse <a href=""//adespresso.com/academy/ads-examples/"">AdEspresso's Facebook Ads Gallery</a> to get an idea of how these would get the word out about your event.
<h3>2. Get an Event App for Your Event</h3>
The official app for SaaStr Annual conference is <a href=""//itunes.apple.com/us/app/saastr-events/id1068306876?mt=8"">SaaStr Events</a>. Users can access the schedules for the event, find networking opportunities, and explore sessions. They can even create their own personal schedule and look up each of the speakers' information to maximize the day's events. The app itself is gamified so attendees earn prizes for being active on the app at the event. Not only do they stay engaged at the event itself but the app lets them get involved before too.

To do that, you need to craft a strategic plan that increases participation and delivers ample value for entrepreneurs on small budgets. Chambers too can create tight-knit communities for different member groups. Here is how to cater to a community of entrepreneurs.</p>

<h2 class=""p1"">Why should you care for the community of entrepreneurs?</h2>
Entrepreneurs are determined to create value, not just for themselves, but for customers, for society. They are persistent in their efforts, often struggling with tight budgets, but that doesn't stop them from their goals. If there is an obstacle on their way, they adjust, change the course and keep on trying. The company is their passion and they strive to improve, to learn more as they go. These motivated individuals can bring new wind to your chamber community.

<strong>Five Qualities That Make Entrepreneurs Valuable Community Contributors:</strong>

i. Tenacity
ii. Confidence
iii. High Adaptability
iv. Passion
v. Desire to Learn
<h2>Communities Are Living Organisms</h2>
Every community is different and continually changing, so it's important to be on the forefront of understanding your community. To do that, you need to ask yourself these questions:

Acquiring said funds can be a huge issue.

<a href=""//contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2016_NonProfit_Research_FINAL.pdf"">About half of nonprofits </a>are strapped for cash.

While their ad ran, 100,000 new students registered in a year and teachers downloaded over 1,500 resources.

At first, web advertising might seem as a bit expensive mean of digital marketing. Nevertheless,  there are plenty of tools which offer free or heavily discounted plans to nonprofits. For example, Google.
<h3>How to start advertising your cause</h3>
To begin with, Google and Facebook—two of the top places to advertise online—are great starting points for nonprofits. They have the widest reach, really easy to set up and scale and allocate more resources to these ads afterward.
<ul>
 	<li><b>Google:</b> Google Ad Grants give your nonprofit $10,000 USD of in-kind AdWords advertising every month, and all you need is a Google nonprofit account and a Google AdWords account to apply. For some excellent tips on how to use Google for nonprofit advertising, <a href=""//www.huffingtonpost.com/laura-packard/how-your-nonprofit-can-us_b_6731854.html"">visit here</a>.</li>
 	<li><b>Facebook:</b> AdEspresso is a tool that helps optimize your Facebook advertising—and they offer a 50% discount to nonprofits who apply and qualify. For some specialized tips on how to use Facebook advertising for your nonprofit, <a href=""//adespresso.com/academy/blog/facebook-marketing-tips-non-profit-organizations/"">visit here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Video</h2>
Video packs a punch. <a href=""//blog.hubspot.com/marketing/video-marketing-statistics#sm.000019111zg5ofdtauzya2ekqnp3z"">80% of users</a> recall a video from the past 30 days, and <a href=""//blog.hubspot.com/marketing/video-marketing-statistics#sm.000019111zg5ofdtauzya2ekqnp3z"">one-third of all online activity</a> is spent watching videos. Making educational or promotional videos can be an incredibly informative way to connect to your audience and increase membership.

Tools like Facebook, Instagram, Vine, Snapchat and, of course, YouTube, enable a single low-budget video to reach a ton of different people.

<em> Charity: Water</em>, an organization that gives clean water to people in need, used their <a href=""//vimeo.com/28104222"">anniversary videos</a> to encourage people to start their own fundraising campaigns. These videos aided in the organization <a href=""//www.charitywater.org/september/11/"">raising over $1.2 million</a>. They were able to buy two drilling rigs and provide water to 80,000 people—double their goal.
<h3>How to make your first promotion video</h3>
[caption id=""attachment_305"" align=""alignright"" width=""380""]<img class=""wp-image-305"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/chuttersnap-135793-300x200.jpg"" alt=""make a video to help your non-profit organization's marketing"" width=""380"" height=""254"" /> Video content is a great way how to engage with people. You can also use it for your Kickstarter campaign.[/caption]

While video can seem like a daunting task, you don't need fancy equipment to send a powerful message. Viral videos are often shot with iPhones, and most computers have free, user-friendly video editing software.

The way how you convey the message is more important rather than how you shoot your video. As a nonprofit, you want people to feel the story you are sharing. After that, they might be inspired to join your membership. There are actually 3 ways you can make your video connect more using psychology:
<ol>
 	<li>Use color</li>
 	<li>Incorporate happy and natural sounds</li>
 	<li>Allow viewers to emotionally connect</li>
</ol>
Here are some tools to get you started.
<ul>
 	<li><b>Wistia: </b>Wistia is a video marketing platform that has analytic, which allows you to see how and where your videos are connecting. They also have calls-to-action within the videos so you can ask your engaged viewers to donate or become a member. They even have a free plan!</li>
 	<li><b>Storytellers for Good: </b>If you have a small budget, Storytellers for <em>Goodwill</em> produce and make beautiful videos like this one for your organization. They also specialize in nonprofit video making, and you won't have to bother with the technical stuff.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Email and Newsletters</h2>
Using email to send out newsletters and other meaningful campaigns is crucial to marketing your message. Most people spend 10-60 minutes browsing marketing emails per week, and email is 40 times more effective at getting someone to make a donation than Facebook or Twitter.

If you're looking for a few examples of how email has helped others achieve amazing growth, <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/event-email-marketing-strategies/"">check out our article on the 10 best event email marketing strategies</a>!

HealthConnect One, an organization that promotes community-driven support for pregnancy, birth, breastfeeding and early parenting, experimented with email campaigns and saw a 50% boost in year-end revenue. It only took four emails over the course of a month for them to create these results.

Thus, Email can help people to know about your cause and re-engage with past donors to make them donate again.
<h3>How to Send Powerful Email Campaigns</h3>
With email, you have the flexibility to send different types of engaging content. You could send specific fundraising campaigns like the HealthConnect One example above. Newsletters are also great because they're recurring, and help you build a loyal reader base.

This example from RSPCA, an anti-animal cruelty organization, has a well-organized newsletter that draws in its readers. It's fun and engaging with plenty of colors, places clear actions to take at the very top, and uses images to catch their eyes.

<h2>4. Social Media</h2>
Building a social media presence is incredibly important, especially if you want to get the attention of the largest generation on the planet—millennials. While using several social media platforms is ideal, one network overshadows the rest by a landslide. 57% of millennials use Facebook every day. <a href=""//mashable.com/2012/12/12/non-profits-social-media-infographic/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+Mashable+(Mashable)#w4AnoGdF1iqD"">Many nonprofits say</a> that it's the best online platform for raising awareness.

UNICEF has an impressive Facebook presence with over 6.5 million likes, an increase in nearly 4 million likes in the past four years.

[caption id=""attachment_297"" align=""alignright"" width=""152""]<img class=""wp-image-297"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/pjimage__11_-136x300.png"" alt=""how non-profits can improve digital marketing"" width=""152"" height=""335"" /> An example of UNICEF Facebook campaign.[/caption]

They regularly post about relevant and current global events and always include a donation link. As a result, their posts always get at least a couple of hundreds of shares.

To sum up, social media is the most low-cost way to get more eyes on your cause—<a href=""//mashable.com/2012/12/12/non-profits-social-media-infographic/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Mashable+%28Mashable%29"">68% of people</a> that discover charities their friends like will continue to research them online.
<h3>How to Build a Prominent Social Media Presence</h3>
In order to build a loyal social media following, it's important to post regularly, show the good you're doing, interact with your users, and to ask for help when you need it. Followers who are inspired by your work will want to help.

Take a look at what other successful nonprofit social media pages are doing and modify for your own organization. We recommend posting photos and videos to catch people's eyes.

Here are some tools to get started.
<ul>
 	<li><b>Facebook </b>is obviously useful for making a page for your organization, but there are even more features you can take advantage of.<b> </b>Facebook Donations is a new feature (currently being rolled out) that makes it easier and cheaper for nonprofits to collect donations on Facebook.</li>
 	<li><b>Buffer </b>is a tool that helps you create meaningful social media plans so you can queue up posts ahead of time. Buffer for Nonprofits offers 50% off of all plans.</li>
 	<li><b>Charitwee</b> allows people to give to a cause directly through Twitter. Similar tools for other social media platforms include Goodworld and SnapDonate.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Marketing for a Cause</h2>
Marketing for a nonprofit is not like marketing for a business. Opposite, the idea is not to increase revenue at all costs, but let people know about you.

In 2020, you don't need a billboard on the side of the highway to tell your cause's story. For almost no money—and with just a little effort—you can reach people digitally in their own homes.",,2017-06-06,post,http://blog.eventbank.com/how-non-profits-can-improve-digital-marketing/,http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nicholas-gercken-68820-e1496730470128.jpg|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/pjimage__11_.png|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/chuttersnap-135793.jpg,"how non-profits can improve their marketing|how non-profits can improve digital marketingmarketing|how non-profits can improve digital marketing",||,||,"non-profit organizations marketing to support their cause|digital marketing|digital marketing",http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nicholas-gercken-68820-e1496730470128.jpg,,"Digital Marketing","marketing|marketing tips|membership|nonprofits",English,,publish,7,Xenia,kseniia.ionova@eventbank.com,Xenia,Ionova,how-non-profits-can-improve-digital-marketing,,,0,0,0,open,open,2019-12-30
323,"Winners of APAC 2017 International Chambers of Commerce Awards","With great pleasure and pride, we have announced the winners of 2017 APAC International Chamber of Commerce Awards earlier this week on <a href=""https://www.eventbank.com/event/5327/"">www.apacchamber.com</a>.

We have carefully gone through all the truly impressive entries that we have received for Awards. We were looking for the chambers with the best chamber's activities, high member acquisition, member engagement strategies, and last but not least - the impact of chambers on their communities in Asia-Pacific region.

Awards were designed to honor individuals and chambers that have made the most significant contributions to the improvement of their communities in the past year. As the number of applications far exceeded our expectations, we have decided to give out two awards for the first APAC Chamber Awards for the following categories: Large Chamber of the Year, Medium Chamber of the Year, Small Chamber of the Year and Executive of the Year.
<h2>Winners of APAC 2017 International Chambers of Commerce Awards:</h2>
<h3>Large Chamber of the Year</h3>
<img class=""wp-image-328 size-medium alignleft"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Amcham-e1496977630552-300x107.png"" alt=""Amcham China logo"" width=""300"" height=""107"" />
<h4>American Chamber of Commerce China</h4>
AmCham China's contributions to the business environment for foreign companies in China facilitates the success not only of AmCham China but also of other chambers of commerce in China who are able to serve their members better thanks to the extensive work of AmCham China. Chamber has also successfully changed its member engagement strategy after extensive update of the member information and research of their preferences. Moreover, past year was a significant milestone for the chamber as it was the first year that chapters brought in more money than their operating costs.

<h4>European Chamber of Commerce Vietnam</h4>
After a lot of planning in 2015, EuroCham Vietnam has been able to execute this plan in the last year. Chamber has established sixteen Sector Committees and a five-person advocacy team in two locations that is in constant communication with the key stakeholders in the Vietnamese Government. Moreover, EuroCham Vietnam has grown its membership base by 9%, while satisfaction level of the existing members has remained strong. Chamber is implementing two European projects, that will help European businesses to enter the Vietnamese market.
<h3>Medium Chamber of the Year</h3>

<h4>British Chamber of Commerce Malaysia</h4>
BritCham Malaysia has had a very successful year. They have hosted many great events (i.e. “Brexit and Malaysia: A New Opportunity” that has attracted more than five hundred attendees), upgraded their technology to serve their members better and become more eco-friendly. Furthermore, the chamber has created The British Business Centre in Malaysia (BBCiM) to assist UK companies in incubating their businesses in Malaysia. To better serve members, BritCham Malaysia has introduced 24-hour respond policy, so members always get their answers within this time frame.

<h4>Mexican Chamber of Commerce China</h4>
<div>MexCham China is the largest Latin chamber of commerce in China that also supports companies and government affairs from other South-American countries that don't have a chamber of commerce in China.

<h3>Small Chamber of the Year</h3>
<img class=""wp-image-332 size-medium alignleft"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/CCI-France-Myanmar-e1496977853564-300x70.png"" alt=""CCI France Myanmar"" width=""300"" height=""70"" />
<h4>French Myanmar Chamber of Commerce and Industry</h4>
French Myanmar Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI France Myanmar) has been probably the most impressive application we have received. Chamber has seen the number of members growing every year for the past 3 years, +23,5% last year), despite the fact that the number of French companies operating in the country as remained almost the same. CCI France Myanmar, with 7 employees, is 100% self-financed and doesn't rely on financial aids from the French institutions. Despite the challenging market and limited budget, the chamber has managed to launch a small business center and offer accredited professional training programs that are first of its kind in Myanmar. Moreover, the chamber has been able to upgrade its technology thanks to which they are now more efficient and members are engaged more.

<img class=""wp-image-333 size-medium alignleft"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Australia-Myanmar-e1496977908172-300x88.png"" alt=""Australia Myanmar Chamber of Commerce"" width=""300"" height=""88"" />
<h4>Australia-Myanmar Chamber of Commerce</h4>
Australia-Myanmar Chamber of Commerce (A-MCC) has just two employees, yet they have been able to attract an interesting mix of members and increase number of members by 50%. A-MCC has also delivered quality events and policy discussions (i.e. the inaugural Women in Business &amp; Leadership Development Gala Dinner and Conference that was attended by over 620 people). Similarly, as CCI France Myanmar, Australia-Myanmar Chamber of Commerce is playing an important role in Myanmar's ongoing reform and development with its educational programs that are giving Myanmar people practical skills and knowledge.
<h3>Executive of the Year</h3>
<h4>Maggie Huang - Senior Director of Operations &amp; GM of Chapters at American Chamber of Commerce China</h4>
After extensive engagement with chapter staff and member leadership, Maggie successfully guided the financial results of AmCham China’s Chapters from an annual loss to a profit. Her term of service is one of the longest at AmCham China and she exemplifies what an executive at a chamber should be: ambitious, farsighted with the execution, and always dedicated to the members.
<h4>Pham Ngoc Hoai Nam - Communications Assistant Manager at European Chamber of Commerce Vietnam</h4>
Pham Ngoc Hoai Nam has successfully strengthened EuroCham Vietnam's exposure capabilities, increased satisfaction levels to a high tier and consolidated her 6 years at the chamber. Moreover, she has supervised trainee program that has resulted in new employees at EuroCham Vietnam.
<h3>Best Member Engagement Program of the Year</h3>
<img class=""size-medium wp-image-334 alignleft"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/FinnCham-HK-300x131.png"" alt=""Finnish Chamber of Commerce Hong Kong"" />
<h4>Finnish Chamber of Commerce Hong Kong</h4>
Chamber has practically reached out to every Finn living in Hong Kong, increased its membership base by 20% and seen a higher attendance of their events, particularly the young professionals as well as on various networking events with other Nordic Chambers. The key to the chamber's member engagement program is listening to the suggestions and opinions of the members, by constant dialogue but also by collecting questionnaires. After listening to the members and hearing their problems, FinnCham Hong Kong then looks for the solutions and organizes workshops and other events to help the members (more than 100 events in 2016). Chamber is also working on a Starter Kit, that will help Finnish businesses with their market entry in Hong Kong.

366,"What is the Best Event Management Software for You?","Being an event organizer is not a job for everyone. As an event planner, you need to see the whole event in a big picture and be able to assign tasks to the right team members. Using the old techniques for organizing events might bring you some difficulties. You have to carry everything in your head and be on your laptop non-stop, correcting, making changes, uploading new data, and sending emails manually.

Sold already and looking for a solution? Book a demo with EventBank today and we'll show you what a true all-in-one event management software suite looks like!
<div>[contact-form-7 id=""3235"" title=""freebies english""]</div>
We all commonly use Excel for tracking, calculating and sorting the data, Microsoft Word for writing drafts, and making the diagrams with results, MailChimp for email invitations and Facebook for promotion. There is not one single program that could fulfill all these needs. And as the size of your event is increasing, the amount of the tasks is growing every day and so does the amount of data and information. In this case, the right event management software might become your best friend. Let's have a look at how to pick the most suitable event management software for you.
<h3><strong>What to Look for in the Event Management Software</strong></h3>
Do you want to organize your event on a totally new level? If so, then first you need to do the research and compare different software which are currently on the market. Usually, the event management software platforms are specialized in managing a specific type of events. For example, trade shows, forums, conferences, meeting with a big number of attendees and so on.
<h3><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-373 size-large"" style=""font-size: 16px;"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/WechatIMG15-1024x683.jpeg"" alt=""event management software"" width=""680"" height=""454"" /></h3>
<h4><strong>Key </strong><strong>Features of the Event Management Software to Look F</strong><strong>or</strong></h4>
<ol>
 	<li>The software can help you <span style=""font-weight: normal !msorm;""><strong>unify all the data</strong></span> that you have and arrange it in the way so you have an easy access to it. You get the opportunity to keep all contact information and activity tracking up-to-date and learn who your attendees are, which sessions of the event they have attended and so on.</li>
 	<li>Your attendees will definitely appreciate <strong>time savings</strong> at the check in (there is no need for printing invitations, bringing a passport or any other documents). What is more, they will be definitely impressed by the new technology.</li>
 	<li>The right event management software also makes it easy to create and manage <span style=""font-weight: normal !msorm;""><strong>agenda, venue selection</strong></span>, and also simplifies the <span style=""font-weight: normal !msorm;""><strong>check</strong></span><strong>-<span style=""font-weight: normal !msorm;"">ins</span></strong> and <span style=""font-weight: normal !msorm;""><strong>registrations</strong></span>. You no longer need to supply your registration desk with laptops, plenty of cables and IT team. The whole check-in process goes smoothly and collects all the necessary data for you and all you need is your smartphone with the internet.</li>
 	<li>The best event management platforms integrate <strong>email marketing </strong>tools as well. Thus, you can create your own branded email invitations or email campaigns and track their success directly on the platform. As well, you can send reminders or follow-ups after the event and have all the communication centralized so you can monitor your engagement with attendees.</li>
 	<li>Good event software should be also able to help you with collecting the <strong>payments, </strong>preferrably giving you and your attendees a variety of payment options.</li>
</ol>
<h3>How to choose the Event Management Software?</h3>
First of all, it is necessary to decide, <em>what do you want to use the software for</em>? Why do you need the special platform to help you? What features does it have to provide you with? If we have a look at the market and compare the existing software, then we can divide them into two groups: single use platforms and multi-functional ones. To the first group, we can designate the products which deal with mainly one function. For example, event ticketing, badges printing, event website development.

However, it is necessary to remember that planning the event or printing the badges is just one of the event’s stages. That's where the second group of platforms come to the place.  These platforms cover all stages of the event - from the first day of planning to evaluation after the event. You should have a clear understanding of pros and cons of the all-in-one software vs narrow-focused tools.

When choosing the event management software you should pay attention to the <strong>customer service</strong>. It should be clearly described how and when you can get a needed support. Ideally, you should get a reply on the question within 24 hours (either through the email, phone or Skype). Additionally, some companies increase the possibilities to be in touch with the clients, by using local and international messengers.

The other thing to do before buying the platform is to set up a demo. It is necessary to see <strong>how the software works</strong>, is it easy to use and if it can make your organization processes easier.

Moreover, it is worth to check if the software <strong>mobile-friendly</strong> or not. Nowadays, more and more people prefer to use mobile devices instead of laptops.

Last but not the least, before signing the contract with the company providing the software, make a <strong>research</strong> about it. Check out its blog, social media networks, if they own ones, and look for the reviews from the past clients.
<h3><strong>Existing Event Management Software </strong></h3>
<h4>Narrow-focused event management tools</h4>

416,"6 Ways to Organize & Promote a Successful Event","Planning a large-scale event can be both stressful and daunting. Not only do you have to focus on event promotion, but you also have to account for possible hiccups on the day of execution. Here are 6 effective guidelines that you can follow in order to make sure that your event runs smoothly and has high turnout rates:

But before you get started, it's suggested to consider booking a demo with EventBank to see how a true event management software solution can help you organize your event alongside our tips here!
<div>[contact-form-7 id=""3235"" title=""freebies english""]</div>
<h3>1. Define what makes your event unique</h3>
The core of your event marketing should be a value proposition or a <strong>unique selling point</strong>. If you can concisely pinpoint the reason that your event is special and worth attending in a sentence or two, people won't want to miss it. In order to find your value proposition, you need to be able to understand the audience you're trying to target and why this event is important to them.
<h3>2. Create an attractive online event page</h3>
Don't give your attendees a reason not to attend your event. Include all relevant details about your event, including <strong>where, when, how, </strong>and<strong> what</strong>, in one centralized location. In order to inform and attract prospective customers, your event description should be attention-grabbing, clear, and concise. Lastly, ensure that your registration process is simple and easy to understand in order to increase attendance rates.

<h3>3. Use effective email marketing</h3>
In a recent survey, Eventbrite and Hubspot found that <a href=""//offers.hubspot.com/the-state-of-event-marketing"">58% of event marketers</a> felt email was their most successful promotional channel. Harness the power of email for your marketing campaigns by personalizing your email marketing. You can do this by greeting guests directly with their name or segmenting your email list into smaller sections. This way, you can include specific relevant information that speaks to each group. The goal is to create productive and engaging emails that will attract more attendees.

[caption id=""attachment_425"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""245""]<a href=""//www.eventbank.com/platform/email-marketing""><img class=""wp-image-425 size-medium"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-10-at-4.46.27-PM-245x300.png"" alt=""example of email marketing campaign for successful event"" width=""245"" height=""300"" /></a> Example of a beautifully designed email marketing campaign from EventBank's platform.[/caption]
<h3> 4. Send reminders to registrants to ensure attendance</h3>
The key to a high turn-out rate is <strong>repeated reminders</strong>. Registrants often will RSVP to an event but ultimately choose not to attend because they were not prompted more than once. Sending email reminders or calling key speakers and registrants several times in the coming weeks before the event will give them the incentive to follow through. Sometimes all a prospective attendee needs is a friendly reminder of your upcoming event.
<h3>5. Over invite</h3>
There is no way to control or guarantee how many people will turn up. Therefore, in order to accurately gauge your expected turnout, you should assume that 10-15% would not come. Over-inviting is a good way to ensure good attendance.
<h3>6. Public Relations Marketing</h3>
Capture potential attendees through various media channels, such as your local TV viewing audience or web outlets. Gain media coverage and increase your company's exposure by creating a news release for media and industry websites. An attractive media release pitch is an effective way to attract people to your event.
<h2>Executing your successful event</h2>
Keeping these six useful tips in mind, you will be able to effectively attract your potential attendees, achieve a maximum turnout rate, and build a favorable and lasting impression of your company's brand on your target audience.

He stated, “it is women who encouraged me to undergo the tough times in the past 18 years since the founding of Alibaba”.

“Many thanks to Jack Ma and Alibaba for providing this honor, Alibaba continues to lead in empowering women globally.” Ms. Ji stated, adding, “Our EventBank team will continue working to create a technology company that creates positive social impact for all.”

EventBank just finished up four awesome days in the country music capital of the world: Nashville, Tennessee. This past week, EventBank hosted their <a class=""_58cn"" href=""https://www.eventbank.com/event/5823/""><span class=""_5afx""><span class=""_58cl _5afz"">#L</span><span class=""_58cm"">aterParty</span></span></a> during the 2017 ACCE Annual Convention. This was a great opportunity for our CEO Eric L. Schmidt and other colleagues to meet with hard-working chamber executive leaders and enjoy some good country music.

<h2>#LaterParty</h2>
What better place to hold our #LaterParty than amongst the sounds of some great Nashville musicians? The #LaterParty was EventBank's way of giving local and international chambers across the US the appreciation they deserve. While enjoying signature drinks and live country music, EventBank representatives met with some impressive chamber executives to discuss the work they are doing for their member communities.

EventBank has already been in partnership with chambers across the Asian Pacific and China, such as the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and the Queens Chamber of Commerce in New York. The use of EventBank's Chamber of Commerce Management Software has helped these chambers to overcome critical strategic challenges. We hope to continue to help chambers in the United States similarly strengthen interpersonal connections and improve management efficiency.

In addition, EventBank gave out custom cowboy hats to those in attendance. They were a hit among the crowd, and even those who weren't chamber members were wondering where the stylish hats came from.

Overall, the EventBank team truly had an awesome time in the city of Nashville. We want to give a warm thank you to every person we met at this event. It was both enjoyable and inspirational to hear about all of the work that chambers around the country are doing. Ultimately, we hope that the EventBank platform can help all chambers overcome their management and member engagement challenges.

535,"EventBank Spotlight: She Loves Tech","Here at EventBank, we’re extremely proud of the array of successful and innovative organizations using our platform, and we think it’s important for us to bring to light the great work they do and celebrate some of the wonderful events our users organize with EventBank.

<a href=""https://shelovestech.eventbank.cn/"">She Loves Tech</a> is of these great organizations; a global initiative aimed to “start more conversations on women and technology”. Co-founded this year by Lean In China and Tech Rock, the events are “global startup competitions held in multiple locations across the world and an international conference held in China”.

&nbsp;

We recently spoke with Rhea See, a member of the She Loves Tech team, on the initiative, why it’s important to encourage women to get involved with technology and how EventBank has helped with the organization and marketing of the events.
<h3>Q&amp;A with She Loves Tech</h3>
<strong>Q</strong>: <strong>What made you start ‘She Loves Tech’ and what are your main goals for the project?</strong>

<strong>A:</strong> Traditionally associated with men, technology actually provides a lot of opportunities that can positively impact women's lives in all parts of the value chain, and She Loves Tech aims to become a platform to encourage this. Starting off with a competition and conference this year, our goal is to take the SLT (She Loves Tech) spirit and expand to more countries next year, have more people involved as well as start more conversations on ‘Women and Technology’.

<strong>Q: Why did you want to make the event specifically female focused?</strong>

<strong>A:</strong> There is a real lack of diversity in technology, there’s a missed opportunity in female consumer led markets and it’s currently a male dominated industry.

<strong>Q: Why do you think it is important that more women get involved in technology?</strong>

<strong>A:</strong> We are seeing an increase of female consumers who are driving growth in multiple industries including technology; we believe we should encourage more women to join the tech industry and to build businesses not just because it’s ‘morally good’, but because diversity is smart business.

Technology creates opportunities for women, whether as entrepreneurs, business executives or consumers. Thus, we want to encourage women to use technology to solve global problems which the world faces and to create wealth, prosperity and social impact.

<strong>Q: ‘She Loves Tech’ is holding competitions/events in many locations in its first year, was there a reasoning behind going to these specific places? (Indonesia, Singapore, HK, Singapore, Canada, Germany, Israel, Pakistan)</strong>

<strong>A:</strong> These locations are all bustling tech hubs not to mention, strategic to China. In fact, although not on purpose, we quickly realized that all these locations are all part of the one belt one road axis.

<h3></h3>
<h3>EventBank's Impact</h3>
<strong>Q: How did EventBank help with the organization and marketing of this event?</strong>

<strong>A:</strong> EventBank’s front-end website matched the modern look and design of our event page, whilst also matching branding of our tech event.

In addition, the registration aspect of EventBank was helpful; different form customization options allowed us to have an organized yet straightforward registration process, which all our global team members could manage easily

Lastly, we found CRM and roles/permissions to be the most helpful aspect of EventBank other than the option for a front-end website.

<strong>Q: Did you consider any other cloud event management platforms and why did you end up choosing EventBank?</strong>

<strong>A:</strong> We eventually chose EventBank due to the platform’s global usability and different server options, and all the features of the platform as mentioned before.

625,"7 Common Challenges Event Organizers Face and How to Avoid Them","<h2>Keep these pitfalls in mind when planning events</h2>
Planning events takes a lot of work, time and dedication. With guest lists, catering arrangements, or planning the decor of the venue, there are a million and one details that need to be coordinated and scheduled. Here are some of the most common challenges that event-organizers face:

<h2>1. Data, Data, Data</h2>
Data is the #1 currency in any industry and the Events industry is no exception. However, it's still a challenge to collect, read, and understand that data so that it can impact your event or future events. Here's some trending challenges that event planners have been facing over the years when it comes to data-driven event management:

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-10534 size-full"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2-columns-1-page-icons-05.png"" alt=""Data Challenges in Event Management"" width=""1929"" height=""1213"" />

[contact-form-7 id=""3235"" title=""freebies english""]
<h2>2. Not Enough Time</h2>
Even the simplest of events have a million different moving parts. To prevent running out of time, create a timeline with <strong>clearly outlined action items. </strong>This timeline should include the months, weeks, and days leading up to your event. This way, you can ensure that the venue will be booked on time, all speakers are confirmed to attend, and that event marketing will be launched early enough to be effective.

<img class=""wp-image-637 size-medium aligncenter"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Corporate-Event-Planning-Checklist-Info-Graphic-Final1-683x1024-200x300.jpg"" alt=""timeline for planning events"" width=""200"" height=""300"" />

Your timeline should <strong>lean on the side of caution </strong>because preparation time is often times underestimated. Most B2B companies spend <a href=""//www.alanizmarketing.com/blog/100-b2b-content-marketing-statistics-2015/"">5-8 weeks</a> planning an event. However, it’s extremely important to set aside extra time to plan your event. This ensures that you have the <strong>flexibility</strong> to deal with possible complications that might arise, such as having to reorder materials or find a new venue.
<h2>3. Not Enough Attendees</h2>
Event organizers often find effective marketing to be a huge obstacle because sometimes it can be difficult to reach out and engage with the right audience. Utilizing a CRM system or taking advantage of personalized email marketing will significantly help to promote your event. Currently, over <a href=""//www.slideshare.net/HubSpot/fascinating-event-marketing-stats"">75% of marketers</a> use email to promote their event, while 47% still use email invites.

There are various types of <a href=""//eventbank.com"">event management software</a> available that event organizers use. By utilizing a personalized marketing software, you can schedule your email campaigns and automatically send out event reminders – allowing you to productively <strong>communicate with your target audience</strong> and achieve <strong>maximum turnout rate.</strong>

[caption id=""attachment_628"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""984""]<img class=""wp-image-628 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Check-Ins.jpg"" alt=""Reach your target demographic"" width=""984"" height=""406"" /> Market effectively to your target demographic using event CRM[/caption]
<h2>4. Speaker Canceled!</h2>
Event organizers should always have a backup plan in case of last-minute cancellations or complications. Booking a venue, getting speakers or artists, and ordering supplies are essential elements to an event’s success. One common mistake that event organizers make is neglecting to prepare an <strong>alternative option</strong>. On the day of the event, an event organizer should be prepared to address anything that could go wrong. For example, outdoor events should always have another venue booked in the case of inclement weather. Many inexperienced event organizers optimistically hope for the best, but successful planners always will have an answer to the worst-case scenario.

[caption id=""attachment_627"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1600""]<img class=""wp-image-627 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/EventBank.jpg"" alt=""Always have a backup when planning events"" width=""1600"" height=""1066"" /> You should always have a backup option prepared for your event[/caption]
<h2>5. Inadequate Budgeting</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5969 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/credit-squeeze-522549_1920.jpg"" alt=""event budgeting"" width=""1415"" height=""1080"" />

Too often, organizations simply track their spending during the planning process and assess along the way. This can result in overspending, and organizations might find themselves <em>literally</em> paying for it in the end. Working within a fixed budget is crucial when organizing an event. Because each cost item for an event can have numerous configurations and choices, an overall budget can vary tremendously.

Having a basic framework from which to sculpt the event ensures that an organization will stay on the right path. <a href=""//EventBank.com"">EventBank platform</a>’s <strong>finance module </strong>displays P&amp;L and also accounts for the amount of money provided by sponsors, helping you to stay on the budget. Staying within the budget should be at the top of every event organizer’s priority.
<h2>6. Messy Registrations</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3803 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/people-wait-in-line-at-the-expo-2010-in-shanghai_4kr6r8fkg__F0000.jpg"" alt=""How to get more attendees"" width=""1920"" height=""1080"" />

The most dreadful thing an event can't experience is a poor registration process. It makes attendees and staff frustrated, it can delay the event, and worst of all it can turn away future attendees. The true way to solve this headache is plenty of set up prior to the event.

Make it so that visitors to your website or event platform page have the ability to register and purchase tickets, leaving more room to breathe at the front door of the event for staff to handle ticket purchases while other team members sign in pre-registered attendees.

Essentially you want to make a smooth motion of Online-to-Offline-to-Online situation.

You want to make sure you capture online registrants, register them offline at the event, then make sure you capture this registration online again for future marketing campaigns. EventBank uses it's own CRM to understand when registrants sign in at events, but other uses similar methods, or allow for lists to be modified like on EventBrite.

On the day of the event, this is the best time to make the most of your set up. We suggest the rule of thumb of having 1 staff member registering attendees per 100 guests. If you're short on staff, split your lines online registrants only, where they can be quickly signed in (this will help incentive other attendees to register online next time), and another line for ticket purchases that go to their own sign in a stand. If your registration platform allows for it, we also suggest self-serve tablets where guests can sign themselves in, reducing the need for staff.
<h2>7. Travel &amp; Housing</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5970 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/navigation-1048294_1920.jpg"" alt=""event travel arrangements"" width=""1440"" height=""1080"" />

When it comes to international or long-distance events with attendees flying or traveling long distances to attend, it can get a little messy when it comes to how you take care of your attendees.

When it comes to international events, it's typically the responsibility of the attendee to plan and manage their travel. This does in effect make the marketing of the event more difficult as you can expect much less conversion rate on registrations as there’s quite a lot of hoops to jump through if the location of the event is politically unreasonable with visas.

For instance, in China, most foreigners will need a visa to enter with a certain degree of failed visas to be expected.

Now it gets tricky if you offer VIP tickets or inviting speakers.

This is when you’ll need to take care of them as now there’s an expectation that this invitee is special, and therefore the event should take care of their travel and housing. So work closely and work well with VIPs to make sure they get their visas. That means booking their flights for them, hotel, and so on.

More and more brands, corporate entities, and nonprofits are <a href=""https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/the-story-of-content-rise-of-the-new-marketing/"">turning to content marketing</a> strategies to optimize their outreach.

<h2>What is content marketing?</h2>
[caption id=""attachment_643"" align=""alignleft"" width=""300""]<img class=""wp-image-643 size-medium"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Content-Marketing-300x162.jpg"" alt=""content marketing strategies for associations, chambers, or nonprofits"" width=""300"" height=""162"" /> Content marketing can help create a loyal community[/caption]

When using content marketing, you aren’t <em>just</em> selling your services  – instead, you are providing truly <strong>relevant</strong> and <strong>useful</strong> content to your members to help them solve their issues. This way, they see your organization as a credible resource on a topic. The “content” may come in the form of blog posts, podcasts, newsletters, webinars, workshops, or any number of other ways to share information. The ultimate goal is to create a <strong>loyal</strong> <strong>community</strong> that will trust your organization and ultimately become a member or a donor.
<blockquote>“<em>Content marketing is a strategic marketing approach focused on creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly defined audience — and, ultimately, to drive profitable customer action.</em>”</blockquote>
<h2>How do you use content marketing strategies for associations, chambers, or nonprofits?</h2>
<h3>1. Identify your community's interests</h3>
[caption id=""attachment_644"" align=""alignleft"" width=""281""]<img class=""wp-image-644 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Amplify.png"" alt=""Target audience"" width=""281"" height=""179"" /> Who are you trying to reach?[/caption]

Before you can begin creating content, you have to understand the types of people you are trying to appeal to. Many chambers of commerce, nonprofits, and associations wonder why their open rates for emails are decreasing. They are not getting high levels of engagement from their members because they're not <strong>adapting to their community's interests</strong>. After identifying the group of people you're trying to communicate with, you can brainstorm on what kind of content will truly <strong>interest</strong> and <strong>educate</strong> that specific group of people.
<h3>2. Develop a strategy</h3>
Developing a strategy is crucial to being successful at content marketing. Ultimately, we want our strategy to accomplish an organizational goal. Ask yourself, what do you hope to accomplish through content marketing? Do you want to increase your number of memberships? Do you want to bring in more donations?

Find a <strong>content niche</strong> that your brand can be a leading informational expert on. The content you produce should be unique and fulfill some kind of need. For example, a chamber of commerce's content ""niche"" would specific to how businesses thrive in the local community.
<h3>3. Choose Specific Topics</h3>
Next, do some <strong>keyword research</strong> to figure out how people are phrasing their searches when they look for these topics online. Align your topics with your targeted long tail keyword phrases and target audience search intent. This will help with your SEO and also ensure that your content will be useful and engage your target audience.
<h3>4. Develop an editorial calendar</h3>
Organizing your time is essential when doing content marketing. In order to pump out content on a regular basis, you’re going to have to think like a publisher and plan ahead. The best way to do this is with an editorial calendar.

Create an <strong>editorial calendar</strong> to map out specific content to be published (such as blog posts), the dates each will be published, and who is in charge of writing the content. You should aim to stick to a regular calendar.

Currently, there are many different types of social media managers that are available for organizations to use, such as <a href=""https://buffer.com"">Buffer</a> and <a href=""https://hootsuite.com/plans/professional?&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=selfserve-bau-na-en--us-pua-google_search_branded_alpha_freeusers-&amp;utm_term=hootsuite&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwiLDMBRDFARIsACNmiX-P6u5nSRLkY_B531f6UsqZxlI0tULfCn8KDZQjeiMYtIBWct05hD0aAhYtEALw_wcB"">Hootsuite</a>. By using their platform, you can create your content all at once and then schedule your posts so that your content is being released consistently throughout a certain period of time.
<h3>5. Create your content</h3>
[caption id=""attachment_649"" align=""alignright"" width=""225""]<img class=""wp-image-649 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/email-marketing.png"" alt=""email marketing"" width=""225"" height=""225"" /> Email marketing can help you distribute your content[/caption]

To help you create your content, you can also perform a <strong>content audit</strong>. Look at all of the content you’ve produced in the past—including blog posts, news articles, videos, brochures—and determine if any of it can be repurposed as educational or entertaining content marketing material.

Extract content from other staff and employees of your organization. They don’t have to be strong writers—you can interview them on their individual areas of expertise, and then turn the information into a blog post.

To test whether or not your content is being well received, you can ask your existing members what type of content they'd like to see from you. For example, after conducting a survey of your members, you might realize that they would like to see a podcast from your organization or chamber. Without collecting feedback, you would have never known what kind of content your community is really looking for.
<h3>6. Amplify your content</h3>
Share your content through social media channels so that you can expand the reach of your content.

Find as many avenues as possible where you can gain exposure and make your content marketing effective. This can include partnering with <strong>key influencers</strong> or investing in <strong>paid media</strong>. <a href=""https://www.eventbank.com/solutions/event-marketing-management-cloud/"">Email marketing</a> is another popular avenue for you to share your content marketing.
<h2>Content marketing is the present – and future – of your marketing</h2>
With content marketing, you can position yourself as a trustworthy and valuable resource. Not only does this help with your SEO, it allows you to more effectively engage with your members. What's more, it is relatively low cost and can bring in long-term results. Done right, successful content marketing will benefit your organization all around, everything from building credibility to expanding your community.

<h2>3. Surprise with Free Stuff</h2>
Give out freebies! Everyone loves them. Gifts could be in the form of candies, promotional products or membership subscriptions depending on your budget. Make it more interesting by giving them out in pieces throughout the event. Get some sponsors, invest in your events and throw some gifts to keep attendees on their toes.

<h2 class=""mceTemp"">4. Create great user experience with a mobile app</h2>
Let your attendees have fun at the event! Use apps through which attendees can follow a schedule, link social media profiles to interact with each other and find people with the same or similar interests.

Encourage them to visit exhibition booths through gamification where attendees can go on QR code hunts (of course for a reward!).
<h2>5. Smooth check-ins to save time</h2>

797,"How to Grow a Community Organization by 1,000 Members in 1 Year","<div class=""prose"">

EventBank is proud to present a spotlight on one of it's most impressive and astoundingly growing organizations using it's one of a kind all-in-one engagement software platform. They were able to grow 1000 members strong after it's inception using EventBank, and through their success comes the fruits of insightful learning. See how this unassuming women's organization made a splash and captures members exponentially, and learn how to grow a community of over 1000 members in less than a year.
<h2>EventBank Spotlight: The Beijing Women's Network</h2>
The Beijing Women’s Network was founded in March 2015 by a group of 12 women brought together by a mutual interest in discussing women’s issues. By December 2016, the network had over 1,300 young professionals and 1,000 women attending events throughout the year. How did an organization led by a group of young professional volunteers grow by over 1,000 members in one year?

In one sentence: We developed a successful leadership structure, executed four quality monthly event series, and utilized technology to increase efficiency and build organization infrastructure.
<h2>Fostering Leadership</h2>
<blockquote>""Some of my most rewarding experiences with the BWN has been watching the way the leadership has grown into itself"". Lily Rogers, Co-Chair of the Healthy Living Series</blockquote>
At the beginning of 2016, we established the Leadership Council and each member was assigned as a co-chair to one event series that would run throughout the whole year. The most important lesson we learned was giving all our volunteers ownership. This was crucial in regards to holding our leadership council accountable for their organization responsibilities and making sure the work got done.

It was important to make our volunteers feel that this was this organization and that they have a voice and decision-making power. In addition, they were passionate about the projects they worked on because they aligned with their personal and professional interests and matched their current skills and skills they wanted to improve.

For women who were highly involved in the organization, we created the “Brand Ambassador” role. These women wanted to play a more active role in the organization and were interested in dedicating their time, resources, connections, and skills to growing and promoting the initiatives of the organization. Both brand ambassadors and Leadership Council attended our monthly planning meetings where we would coordinate for upcoming projects, events, and administrative tasks. Over 40 Brand Ambassadors played a vital role in executing our first <a href=""//www.eventbank.cn/event/6168/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Annual “Women in Leadership” Gala</a> on November 11th, 2016.

The tone of our organization always remained consistent: strive to be the best versions of ourselves through community building, knowledge sharing, positivity, and helping others. Through running these events, we all sharpened our public speaking, event and organization management, and leadership abilities which made us better at our full-time jobs.
<h2><strong>Organization Leadership Takeaway</strong>:</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>Give volunteers specific tasks and responsibilities that fit into their personal and professionals goals.</li>
 	<li>You need to provide value, show appreciation, and create opportunities for growth and professional development for everyone involved in your organization.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Running Quality Event Series</h3>
Initially, the original three administrators coordinated all of the different tasks for all the events series. This changed after establishing the Leadership Council and our events ran much more efficiently as our admins had more concrete roles. Through our Healthy Living, Professional Development, Pregnant, Marriage, and Motherhood (PMM) dinners, and Spotlight dinners, we were able to cover a diverse range of topics affecting the personal and professional lives of our members.

Every woman led a series that overlapped with their current position, career goals, and interests. Samantha Kwok, CEO of<a href=""//jingjobs.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer""> JingJobs</a>, and I co-chaired the Professional Development Series as our day job were related to strengthening soft and hard skills from networking to Chinese social media.
<blockquote>Samantha emphasized “the more I got involved the more I realized how many young professionals who genuinely needed advice, mentorship and answers to some of their professional development questions that were not getting answered or addressed in their current work environments”.</blockquote>
As a headhunting expert, Sam organized a “Changing Jobs and Industries” panel. As the marketing coordinator for a software company, I organized our <a href=""//www.eventbank.cn/event/6227/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">“Women in Technology” panel</a> highlighting women leaders in China’s start-up and corporate ecosystem. Being young professionals, we were able to choose and control every aspect of the event based on the issues and topics that we were most interested in.

We used our network to find expert speakers and ensured we prepped them with panel questions and any additional information they needed. We collected feedback from every event and incorporated it into the next events. As we ran more events, we added interesting components and add-ons like hiring a head-shot photographer from <a href=""//www.pekingproductions.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Peking Productions</a> for our “Personal Branding and Professional Confidence” event. We took a lot of pride in our events and worked hard to make sure that they were a reflection of Beijing Women’s Network values and purpose.
<h3><strong>Event Management Takeaways</strong>:</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>The main focus of your events should be providing value for your community, sharing knowledge, and building authentic relationships.</li>
 	<li>Having event series instead of one-off events helps to build brand awareness and consistency.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Utilizing Technology</h2>
Everyone in Mainland China is connected through an all-in-one, multi-function social media platform called <a href=""//www.economist.com/news/business/21703428-chinas-wechat-shows-way-social-medias-future-wechats-world"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">WeChat</a> that integrates messaging, a newsfeed, and online payment for products and services. Through our WeChat groups and EventBank platform, we were able to easily engage our community and efficiently manage our organization. Beijing Women’s Network began as a WeChat group that shared events and job descriptions as well as provided professional support relating to living, working, and being a woman in Beijing. Our WeChat accounts along with our event series consistently provided value and a sense of community for our members.

[caption id=""attachment_820"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1154""]<a href=""//www.eventbank.cn/org/beijingwomen/#""><img class=""wp-image-820 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Untitled-1-e1504591608184.png"" alt=""How We Grew Our Community Organization by 1,000 Members in 1 Year"" width=""1154"" height=""692"" /></a> Event web page of Beijing Women's Network event on our EventBank platform[/caption]

We created a standard message when new members were added that introduced them to the network and admins, set rules for the group’s discussion, and everyone on Leadership Council would moderate the groups accordingly. Through word of mouth, new members were added to the Beijing Women’s Network groups. As we expanded, we had to open up two more groups as each WeChat group has a 500-person maximum.

Our WeChat platform allowed us to easily engage our members but we were wasting a lot of time on manual labor and none of our contacts, events, or email campaigns were tracked or centralized. We began our technology partnership with <a href=""//www.eventbank.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">EventBank</a>, an all-in-one platform that integrates event and membership management, email campaigns, online payment, and CRM, in December 2015. The goal was to have 500 members by the end of the year and we surpassed that number in March 2016 by doubling our organization in size after 3 months of using the platform. We exceeded 1,000 members three months later in July 2016.

<div>[contact-form-7 id=""3235"" title=""freebies english""]</div>
This new system cut out several inefficient manual practices and allowed us to run a high volume of professional events. We were able to promote our events through WeChat, accept online registration and payment, and use mobile check-in for all events. The professional <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/event-website-builder/"">event websites</a> could be shared through WeChat moments and groups as well as various of other social media channels.

Through the CRM, we could account for the growth or our organization as event attendees were automatically tracked. It gave us the infrastructure to grow as new volunteers could easily use the platform and start working on new projects. Another benefit of utilizing technology for your organization is establishing legitimacy and expanding your reach within your community.

<h2> Conclusion</h2>
Through all of our events, we were able to raise 20,000 RMB in 2016 for our charity, the <a href=""//www.unitedfoundation.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">United Family Foundation</a> and make a positive impact on the lives of over a thousand foreign and Chinese women.

832,"Chambers of Commerce: Are membership directories relevant in the digital era?","Chambers provide a platform for people to connect. They offer prime networking opportunities to develop new contacts and solid resources to help businesses start, manage and grow their companies. One of the ways how chambers of commerce connect their members are membership directories.

Membership directories help thousands of consumers find business partners, contacts, and other like-minded people. Running a single business can be difficult but managing a dozen to hundreds of thousands of members is tougher. <a href=""https://robdkelly.com/blog/business-networking/chambers-of-commerce-tips/"">More than 60 percent of businesses join chambers because of networking</a>. How can chambers effectively utilize their business network to easily match members with other members?

According to our research, about 80 percent of chambers still go with the traditional printing of membership directories, which also works but these chambers are at the risk of becoming irrelevant. Some chambers also have online business directories available on their websites, but that might be not enough. Over the years, mobile usage has taken over desktop usage and this goes to show how much your organization is missing out if you still think ""mobile friendly"" instead of ""mobile first"". Chambers have limited resources and may not be able to keep up with technological trends.
<h2>Upgrade your membership directories</h2>
Most of the leaders in both developed and emerging markets are mobile. They stay ahead by embracing each new advanced technology which helps improve productivity and efficiency in business, connect with new clients and markets and compete with much larger players in the industry. Chambers run the risk of losing out on potential members to mobile tools if they do not quickly adapt to the realities of today's market.

IT companies have come up with solutions that address the challenges of staying relevant and connected in this digital age. It is important to reach your audience through mobile communication<span style=""color: #000000;""> </span>as well as provide them with a great mobile experience. Mobile apps like <a href=""https://www.eventbank.com/platform/eventbank-app-attendee-members"">EventBank App</a> make membership directories available not only on chamber websites but also in the mobile app, where members can access information about other members anytime.

Having membership directory online and mobile does not only save trees and the annual cost of traditionally printing books; members get to edit and update their information and set limitations as to what information is available to different groups of people. They can also effectively connect with other members directly from the app, bringing your member engagement to new heights. This brings a whole new life to printed membership directories, for which your members will thank you.

Below are some tips on how your chamber of commerce could craft a strategic plan that increases participation and delivers ample value for entrepreneurs on small budgets.

890,"Notes from the EventBank CEO- Problems facing event organizers","Eric L. Schmidt started China Entrepreneurs in 2003 with about 20-30 participants and then grew to 200-300 members. Leveraging their experience and resources, the company grew from organizing monthly evening events to organizing numerous professional conferences and forums from Beijing to Hong Kong to New York and England. Around 2008-2012, they held more than 100 conferences a year.

[caption id=""attachment_905"" align=""alignright"" width=""1920""]<img class=""wp-image-905 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/IMG_2425-1.jpg"" alt=""problems facing event organizers"" width=""1920"" height=""1073"" /> China Entrepreneurs turned into a professional organization consisting of over 20,000 Chinese and international members. [Eric and the team back in 2011 at a forum in Beijing][/caption]&nbsp;

However, operations started taking too much time and resources. They realized they couldn’t scale beyond that due to challenges and limitations of their organization. Looking back, these are some of the challenges Eric faced as an event organizer/CEO and how he managed to pull through them.
<h2>1. Manual Processing</h2>
Doing things manually can be manageable at the start of a business. However, it becomes laborious as the company grows. Not only does manual documents take up a lot of space, organizing and finding information when needed is time consuming. The more time spent on copying and pasting emails, dealing with payments or checking in attendees, the lesser the time you have left to focus on making the event better and more meaningful. Manual processes are subject to human error and this affects the level of productivity of an organization.
<h2>2. Failure to build on the success of one event</h2>
Because data and information is stored on multiple devices across different applications, people look at events in isolation. They are not able to analyze the little details and try to learn from last event to improve the next one. Basically, it’s difficult to see the larger picture as to how your organization can put on more successful events when the contents of previous events are not unified.
<h2>3. Inability to fully engage your audience</h2>
It is difficult to manage information of individual event participants. Most people focus mainly on the logistics of an event and do no really consider how to properly engage their audience. Since there is little understanding of preferences and interest of attendees, you may end up focusing on the wrong topics or speakers for your events.
<h2>4. Not being able to communicate adequately</h2>
Organizing successful events requires a lot of efforts and you could use all the help you can get. The unexpected always happens when planning an event irrespective of the technology in use. It is important to have the right people in your team. Effective team work depends on good communication. Both internal and external communication may become strenuous and miscommunication can affect the smooth operations of your organization.

<hr />

<h2>What was the way forward?</h2>
Realizing that his organization was not the only one facing these challenges, Eric came up with an idea. He started a project- EventBank with the hope of overcoming these obstacles. Later, what started as a project scaled up rapidly and he found out from other event organizers that there was actually a market for it. <a href=""https://www.eventbank.com"">EventBank</a> was established to help all professional communities share resources and create opportunities for success by moving information to an easily accessible platform. EventBank helps increase productivity and allows event organizers to do the following;

1. Plan, promote and execute events more efficiently. With an automated workflow, people can register and make payments online for events. Event organizers can also monitor which members are coming to events.

2. Create blueprints that sync event information to help use the pattern of  past events to develop next events.

3. Get the chance to track every detail about attendees and understand them better. This helps event organizer know where to focus their outreach to make events large-scale and more meaningful.

984,"5 Content Marketing Hacks that get 5,000 Attendees to Your Event","In 2011, not many people knew who Jason Lemkin was. Sure, he'd just sold his SaaS company to Adobe for a nice sum, but he didn't stand out from other successful entrepreneurs. Yet somehow, just four years later, he got a whopping 5,000 attendees to show up to his first ever <a href=""//saastrannual.com/"">SaaStr Annual Conference</a>.

Lemkin's secret was content marketing. He joined Quora and started answering people's questions. He set up his website and started writing down all the stuff he wished someone had told him when he was building his company.

A few years of crafting genuinely useful content got him a bullet-proof brand in B2B tech. By answering founders' toughest questions, giving them actionable tips, and helping them solve the hard problems on the entrepreneurial journey, he earned deep credibility in the SaaS community.

So when he used content to promote his first event, attending felt like a no-brainer for those thousands of attendees.

That sounds like a pipe dream to most event marketers. But it's totally within your reach if you get an early start creating content that resonates with your target audience. Then, you can weave your event into that larger strategy and position it as something your audience is excited to be a part of.

Here are the five best content marketing tactics to get more attendees to your next event.
<h2>1. Blog Early and Often</h2>
Jason Lemkin's blog is the center of his content marketing strategy, so it makes perfect sense that he <a href=""//www.saastr.com/ok-its-a-go-the-saastr-annual-feb-5-with-the-ceos-of-box-mobileiron-guidespark-opendns-zenefits-talkdesk-betterworks-and-more-does-it-get-any-better/"">started promoting his first event with a blog post</a>.

The post wins with its simplicity, telling readers the time, place, and why they should go: hands-on SaaS advice from top experts. It also creates urgency to commit now by emphasizing that there are only 100 discounted “early bird” tickets available.

Your blog is where you tell your audience how to solve the pressing problems in your industry and update them about what's happening at your company. The people who read it regularly are your biggest fans and best customers. They'll be the most interested in attending the event, so if you nail that first blog post announcing it, you'll get immediate ticket sales.

But don't stop there. There are plenty of other times and places you should be blogging about your event:
<ol>
 	<li>Blog an announcement every time you book a new speaker or panelist.</li>
 	<li>Ask those speakers to do a guest post on your blog promoting the event. Then, write your own guest post on <i>their</i> blog. It's a great way to expand your event's reach.</li>
 	<li>Put up a blog telling readers when tickets are starting to run low.</li>
</ol>
Blogging lets you highlight the benefits of your event, get immediate ticket sales from your most dedicated audience members, and sustain interest in the months leading up.
<h2>2. Build the Event its Own Microsite</h2>
Your event needs one central hub where future attendees can learn everything they need to know and, of course, buy their ticket.

Your first instinct might be a landing page, but that isn't enough room to convey all the information your target audience needs. Sure, there's the simple stuff like time and location, but you also have to answer the most important question of all: Why should they go to this thing? Your event needs a compelling brand to draw people in.

Want to host your own event microsite? Book a demo and see how it works on EventBank today.
<div>[contact-form-7 id=""3235"" title=""freebies english""]</div>
A microsite is the best way to give your audience a full understanding of your event. Check out this one Price Intelligently created for SaaSFest, its yearly <a href=""//www.saasfest.io/"">conference on how to grow a SaaS startup</a>. It's nothing fancy, just one continuous page you scroll down. But it says everything you need to know.

[caption id=""attachment_987"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""680""]<img class=""wp-image-987 size-large"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2016-07-28-at-6.37.51-PM-1024x452.png"" alt=""Mircosite example of SaaSFest as event website to draw attendees"" width=""680"" height=""300"" /> Example of SaaSFest's microsite event website to draw attendees to the event.[/caption]

The site is structured to drive visitors toward buying a ticket. It starts with a simple value proposition: This is an event for SaaS growth. If you run a SaaS startup, that would be enough to grab your attention. If that confirmed your initial interest, you'd keep scrolling to see the details.

The logic of the site is airtight: It starts by creating interest, then gives its target audience a way to act on it.

You'll link readers to your microsite whenever you mention the event in other pieces of content. So set it up as soon as you decide the event is on. Even if you don't have your speakers, venue, or even the date set yet, just get your microsite up and add to it as you go. You can use software such as <a href=""//www.eventbank.com/solutions/event-marketing-management-cloud"">Event Marketing Cloud</a> from EventBank that has the capability to <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/event-website-builder/"">create beautiful microsite event pages</a>.
<h2>3. Run a Contest</h2>
Contests are a great way to get people excited about your event. After all, everyone wants to be a winner. But it won't work if your contest is just another Twitter sweepstakes that have been done a million times. It needs to be tailored to your audience and feel like a logical extension of your brand.

[caption id=""attachment_986"" align=""alignleft"" width=""326""]<img class=""wp-image-986"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2016-07-29-at-11.01.16-AM-300x294.png"" alt=""Email contest as a content marketing tactic to get more attendees to your event."" width=""326"" height=""319"" /> Example of an email contest as a content marketing tactic to get more attendees to your event.[/caption]

Email design company Litmus used a unique, one-of-a-kind contest to promote its event.

Inspired by Willy Wonka, Litmus used coding tricks to hide five golden tickets to the Email Design Conference inside an email promoting the event. The first person to find each ticket and tweet at Litmus with proof got to attend for free.

Litmus' contest was perfect for its audience. Litmus helps marketers <a href=""//litmus.com/"">design and send beautiful emails</a>, and that's the focus of the conference as well. Anyone passionate about email design—the ideal attendee for the conference—was sure to get excited to look for those easter eggs. Recipients forwarded the email countless times, which expanded the reach for the event and helped Litmus <a href=""//litmus.com/blog/the-5-email-easter-eggs-that-helped-sell-out-the-email-design-conference"">sell out its early bird tickets in ten minutes</a>.

Great contests aren't generic. Tap into your company's unique image or value-add to design a contest that'll be irresistible to your target audience.
<h2>4. Give Attendees a Say</h2>
Year in and year out, South by Southwest is one of the biggest, most successful media festivals in the world. It's nailed the art of producing a great event, but even SXSW doesn't plan the whole thing on its own. It uses its <a href=""//panelpicker.sxsw.com/about"">PanelPicker</a> to let attendees submit topics they want to see covered by different speakers and vote for the most popular ones.

It feels like SXSW is doing attendees a huge favor. In a way, they are. But they're also encouraging attendees to send the PanelPicker around to their friends to get their favorite topic upvoted, widening the audience.

Your attendees are the people on the front lines of your industry wrestling with the tough issues every day. Giving them a voice ensures that your event covers the most pressing, timely topics.

But more importantly, giving attendees a sense of ownership over the event makes it feel more like a real community your company is bringing together, and not just a bunch of people who happen to work at similar companies.

You don't even need to create your own PanelPicker or let attendees vote. It's as simple as giving them a way to talk to you. You could set up a series of webinars before the event to give attendees a chance to tell you what they want to learn about.
<h2>5. Make a Video Preview</h2>
Customers love video content. Studies show that a video can <a href=""//blog.hubspot.com/marketing/video-marketing-statistics#sm.0000fsq57cy7qdevrim1v5yzc5fs5"">boost a landing page's conversion rate by 80%</a>. What's true for SaaS sites is also true for your event. If you've done events before, you probably have great footage from previous years that you can use to market this year's event.

No one knows the power of video marketing better than the experts at Wistia, so it's no surprise that video is a key part of how they <a href=""//wistia.com/wistiafest/2016"">promote their annual WistiaFest event</a>.

WistiaFest has been going strong for three years now. That means Wistia has plenty of material from its previous conferences to create a video. This way target audiences can see what they can expect at the next 'Fest and why they should be excited.

If this is your company' first event, you could pull videos of your experts speaking at other conferences, or even get the team together and make your own promotional video. As hard as videos can be, the payoff can be huge. They engage more of the senses than the written word and let you show your audience what your event will actually look like.
<h2>Your Event Needs A Platform</h2>
Between the venue, speakers, and food, events are tough to put together. But if you only invest in the event itself, all of your hard work might be for nothing. You also need to build a brand for your event.

<a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/event-management/hacks-impress-attendees-next-event/"">Content marketing</a> is the best way to do it. These strategies enable you to pull in your core audience, reach new people, and enhance your company's image within your industry.

We'd be more than happy to show you how EventBank can fit into your next event and get you that 5000-person strong turnout you've always wanter.

1041,"Webinars vs. Seminars: Are Webinars Going to Steal the Show?","It used to be that when choosing between hosting an event like a seminar or a webinar, there would need to be sacrifices made for either. An in-person seminar is more or less determinant on the ability that attendees can physically make it to the event, lowering its overall footprint, but then you could have a paid event where attendees could purchase tickets. Whereas for webinars two major aspects are usually sacrificed, paid ticketing becomes difficult to implement when links can be shared freely, and networking <del>is</del> was almost impossible popular webinar platforms. The main benefits of webinars had been its much wider and global footprint.

Wikipedia has defined these 2 event types individually:
<ul>
 	<li>A <strong>seminar</strong> is <em>‘a meeting held for the exchange of useful information by members of a common business community.’</em></li>
 	<li>A <strong>webinar</strong> is '<em>an interactive seminar conducted via the World Wide Web.</em> Usually a live presentation, lecture, or workshop that happens in real-time, as users participate through chatting, video-chatting, file-sharing, or asking questions with a microphone.’</li>
</ul>
Things are changing quickly, however, and the gap between these event formats is narrowing, so let's take a look at what's being brought to the table that might make webinars the new in-demand event format in the near future.
<h2>Seminars and In-Person Events</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16771 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/eventbank-blog@2x.png"" alt=""in person event seminars"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Seminars and other physical in-person events have and generally will always be a great way to engage an audience. Multi-track events, multi-day panels, Q&amp;As, break out sessions, and more add to a seminar's value because though it's not openly said, most people go to events for the networking aspect as much as the content of the event. For that reason events had always out-paced seminars in the past. Where else could you target customers for a quick chat? It's more engaging, higher quality lead generation, and of course, the content is more raw and unapologetically tangible at a seminar.

Furthermore, the venue of an event gives a simple aspect that makes it easier to charge for tickets. The front door. By having control over who can enter the event, it becomes more exclusive, and by having exclusivity, you can then add value to your ticketing so long as your audience shares that same value (so don't <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/hacks-impress-attendees-next-event/"">skimp on the content</a>).
<h2>Webinars</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16882 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/eventbank-blog-COVID@2x.png"" alt=""webinar tips"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Before, webinars would have been considered a non-ROI focus for a lot of business's event strategies. When it comes to webinars, links to the webinar can be shared and were, for a time, easily accessible by anyone who had the link. There were no front-doors.

Furthermore, with your fairly run of the mill webinar platform of choice only a year ago, chances were you lacked a lot of features that would have really rounded out the viewer's experience, like even having the attendees the ability to speak to the host. Direct messaging, profile viewing, and other examples of engagement tools were missing, and some platforms were lucky to even offer live chat during the webinar for Q&amp;As and discussions.
<h3>Networking and Paid Ticketing Coming to Webinars</h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-17276 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/business-carrd@2x.png"" alt=""webinar digital business card exchange"" width=""1986"" height=""1666"" />

With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, almost all in-person events were cancelled in a bid to break the circuit of the virus, and in doing so left many events translating to an online model through webinars. This has spurred webinar platforms to rapidly change and develop more in-demand tools to help companies monetize their online events, and then benefit attendees with better networking options.

Platforms now require or can require accounts to be made with links that are only available to those who have an account, and it can even narrow it down to those that have an account and then also have confirmed the purchase of the ticket. This means that webinars now have that front door they so desperately needed as links cannot be shared and accessed publically.

It's now becoming more and more common for webinars to charge tickets for their events. But like seminars, it's important to offer higher quality content that attendees agree is valuable.

Further, with the updates on these major platforms, or integrations with tools that allow for these updates, attendees are being offered more engaging ways to network at webinars. Attendees who seek evens for networking opportunities will easily find a digital strategy for themselves now as webinars offer better features.

Some features like direct messaging already soothe a lot of the headaches for attendees who crave networking while on a webinar. For hosts who want focus on the webinar and less direct messaging, distracting other attendees can offer digital business card exchanging so that attendees can create their own digital business contact name card for themselves and exchange with other attendees who can choose to accept and reply with their own cards which is less distracting than text conversation butting into their webinar experience.
<h2>The Gap is Narrowing</h2>

The big difference between webinars and seminars had always been a trade-off that needed to be made. Did you want more engagement with a larger audience? Then you needed a webinar that delivered less networking to attendees, and you couldn't really charge them for attending.

Did you want an event with exclusivity that you could charge for? Then you needed an in-person seminar that could offer benefits like networking for instance that you could count on for bringing value to your tickets.

These questions will likely become less and less pertinent as it seems that webinars are catching up and filling the gap that used to exist between the two event formats. Truly webinars have made strides even as recently as in the past month, offering features that fill the needs of attendees and offer tools that make it more realistic to monetize an online event. Soon you'll find that in-person events will be offering better content, more exclusivity, or even cheaper ticket prices so that they can start to compete in a world where webinars are becoming the easier option for businesses going forward after COVID-19.

Happy hosting!

1076,"5 Event Management Trends for Your Next Event","Gone are the days of manual planning and scrutinizing over every tiny detail. Event management technologies have evolved significantly in recent years, and they’re no longer the well-coveted secret of large and international enterprises. Access to these technologies has never been easier, for SMEs and multinationals alike. Undergoing constant development, companies like EventBank are introducing new and improved features aimed at accuracy and efficiency in event organization processes. Trends in event management are getting more odd and technological, and EventBank is a reflection of some of these trends.

Event management is an ever-changing industry, and keeping on top of new trends and technologies needs to be a top priority. Event attendees, corporate or otherwise, have higher expectations of event planners than they did ten years ago. But meeting these expectations don’t have to be an arduous task with the use of innovative new technologies.

<h2 id=""software"">Event Management Software Adoption</h2>
Only with an <a href=""//fitsmallbusiness.com/reviews/event-management-software-reviews/"">event management software</a> can you personalize an attendee’s experience, and their interaction with your company. 2020 is saying goodbye to the manual process, and hello to the fully-automated all-in-one event management cloud!

Once attendance is assured, it is equally as important that check-ins on the day run just as smoothly, and with as much precision as the event lead up. Checking in to an event should be even simpler than event registration, and all-in-one event management software makes this a reality.

Unlike in the past, where attendees were queueing for twenty minutes, or in extreme cases, hours, outside the event venue, event management software has improved the efficiency check-in processes remarkably. In fact, event check-in should be so seamless a process that attendees do not even think about it besides providing their name. Queues do not belong at events in the twenty-first century, and event management software is ensuring this.

We’ve already established that event attendees are expecting personalization from event planners and check-ins so smooth they go unnoticed, but they’ll also be expecting mobile, pocket accessible networks and networking opportunities. <a href=""//www.eventbank.com/platform/mobile-apps"">With separate apps for event managers, attendees and members EventBank</a> has transformed the way communities network and improved the engagement between organizations and attendees. Staying in the loop with business and event updates is an understandable expectation to have, and mobile apps are delivering on this.

<div>[contact-form-7 id=""3235"" title=""freebies english""]</div>
<h2 id=""vip"">The VIP Experience</h2>
Event attendees like to be made to feel that they are important and that their interests and expectations matter to event planners. Event planning software, such as EventBank, have built-in features to give your attendees a personalized VIP experience from the moment the invitation is sent. Using the <a href=""//www.eventbank.com/platform/crm-business"">CRM function</a>, you are able to filter people by their job title, previous event attendance, and even dietary preference, giving them the impression that you – as the host – know and care about their event experience.

This feature also means that event planners have the capability to personalize the marketing of an event by segmenting their CRM into groups of similar interests or experience. This database of knowledge enables you to tailor your approach to individuals or groups in getting their registrations and ultimately, attendance.

[caption id=""attachment_1077"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""499""]<img class=""wp-image-1077"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/rawpixel-com-423667-3-300x200.jpg"" alt=""event management technologies, networking at event using event mobile apps"" width=""499"" height=""332"" /> Networking in your own time on an <a href=""//www.eventbank.com/platform/eventbank-app-attendee-members"">event mobile app</a> could look like this.[/caption]
<h2 id=""integrations"">All-in-One Integration</h2>
Event organizers will experience improvements to their marketing campaigns, approach to customer relationship management and real-time analytics. These interactions enable you to draw conclusions about what your attendees look for in an event, and how they respond to your marketing tactics – both invaluable to planning a successful event. Without event management technology, data and metrics relating to the success of, or engagement of an event are nearly inaccessible.

As mentioned previously, event management software enables the event planner access to comprehensive data and analysis about their members’ and attendees’ interaction with an event. Information such as how many events a member has attended, how many newsletters they are subscribed to, and how many of them they are opening is all available to you with the click of a button. These insights are absolutely vital in the landscape of modern event management, as they enable improvements and customizations to be made with an efficiency that wasn’t available ten years ago.

At EventBank we’re aware that that event planning is a complex process, which is why <a href=""//www.eventbank.com/platform/event-management"">we’ve created an all-in-one platform</a> which simplifies the event management task. You no longer need multiple applications, tabs or notebooks open at any one time because the EventBank platform logistically manages your event all from one easy-to-use platform.
<h2 id=""virtual"">Virtual Reality</h2>
While it’s still relatively new, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies are attractions which event organizers should take advantage of, and incorporate them into their event agendas.

Slowly encroaching into the territory of mainstream media, VR and AR technologies will be event essentials in the not too distant future. In fact, recently in December 2017, a Facebook event using the EventBank all-in-one event management cloud in Beijing employed the use of VR technologies – an exciting first for us!

We have an awesome guide on how to get started <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/event-vr-guide/"">using VR at events</a>!

They are immersive technologies that are sure to guarantee attendee satisfaction and enjoyment. Word-of-mouth marketing will still be as valuable as ever, and linking your company with VR and AR technologies by incorporating them into your event will have social media abuzz with photos and discussions from your event.

VR and AR also have a conversational ‘ice-breaking’ potential in networking situations, which is sure to help your attendees maximize their networking intentions in event attendance. Companies like Facebook, Samsung, Coca-Cola, and Google have all already invested in, and incorporated VR and AR technologies into their events and seen huge improvements in attendee engagement. VR is not only a ‘trend’ to watch and participate in, but it’s also an event asset here for the long haul – so be sure to get on board now!
<h2 id=""chairs"">Fewer Chairs</h2>
Event organizers around the world are starting to hop on a recent trend of offering less seating than the expected amount of attendees.

What's that? Not enough seats for attendees? Isn't that supposed to be rule #1 in event management?

Well, yes.

But no, these days engagement has become the #1 indicator for success at events <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/event-planning-checklist/"">large and small</a>, and less about how many heads you can count in the room. By creating an engaging space that encourages interaction and networking among your attendees, why give them seating? People get less mobile, relaxed and frankly just too lazy to get up and meet others.

By providing less seating you're creating a reason for people to get up and walk around, move, and end up talking to people they wouldn't have had they been sitting. Of course offer baseline seating for folks who can't stand for long periods, but don't give people a reason to plop down.

There is currently an enormous industry demand for a fully-automated all-in-one event management software, and EventBank has answered the call with absolute precision. EventBank’s event management cloud is on-trend with what’s to come in event planning for 2020.

1101,"Guide to Check-Ins","<div>As an event organizer, you want things to go smoothly at the check-in. It is important to maintain client and customer satisfaction and at check-in it is your chance to set the tone for your event. Check-ins can make or break things. A smooth check-in can encourage positive involvement of visitors as well as encourage client and customer returnees. However, at any kind of event, there are challenges and things that can go wrong. Many things can go wrong at check-in, but worry not and keep reading. This short check-in guide will help you start your events on a high note.</div>
<h2>The Devil is in the Details</h2>
<div>Firstly, guests may get lost as they've received directions which are too vague or complicated. Others may just follow the crowds assuming that everyone else knows what they're doing. Other customers join the wrong queue and with a slow moving line they only realize when reaching the front. At specific venues there may be items which are prohibited, leading to visitors having items are confiscated; this is particularly frustrating when the item seems innocent such as a water bottle. A larger problem occurs when visitors have forgotten or lost their tickets or don't have the correct ID, or indeed they may not have realized ID was required.</div>
<h2><b>Plan Ahead </b></h2>
<div>Fortunately there are many solutions and opportunities to overcome these challenges and enable a smooth event check-in experience. Firstly, make the venue plans clear and located at entrance ways. Plans could also be printed on the back of tickets. When sending ticket confirmations, be sure to include a link to the venue plan and give an option to save to a smartphone. By then linking entrance point information to the plan <a href=""https://smallbusiness.chron.com/importance-signage-business-3348.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">combined with clear signage</a>, you will enable visitors to be easily directed to the correct check-in desk.</div>
<div>It is also useful to provide security information with the ticket confirmation, as well as highlight any specifics or items that may be overlooked.Details of refreshment outletsat the venue if food/drink is prohibited are also very helpful. Finally, eTickets and the option to register ID before attending the venue can be a technological fail safe when documents get lost. Using an app can also make <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/event-management/hacks-impress-attendees-next-event/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">difficult check-ins a thing of the past</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Identifying the challenges and putting in place the solution is a key step in being prepared, this can make a difference and ensure a fantastic experience for attendees. Providing a check-in process that minimizes stress will not only reduce problems but give customer satisfaction and ultimately help shape a positive event experience.</div>",,1970-01-01,post,http://blog.eventbank.com/?p=1101,http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/guide-to-event-check-ins-onsite-e1519363699755.jpg,"guide to event check-ins onsite",,,"eticket, onsite check in, event management cloud, event organizers",http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/guide-to-event-check-ins-onsite-e1519363699755.jpg,,"Event Management",,English,,draft,14,cass,social@eventbank.com,Cass,Talley,guide-to-check-ins,,,0,0,0,open,open,2018-03-07
1110,"9 Tips For Effective Networking at Events, Meetings, and Conferences","The foundation of networking (creating a network of contacts) is to find people who can help you develop your careers. Scientists have discovered that a larger social network helps career growth, gaining lucrative jobs, raising salary and overall job satisfaction. You do not have to be an influential person or the most open person in the world to communicate effectively with others.

Take a step forward. Start with people you know from work or social life and attend a networking event. Keep your ears tight and listen to information that can bring you an edge.
<h2>Scary Networking</h2>
Unless you're used to this idea, networking can make you horrified. You might think it's something for very self-confident types that get the best job anyway. But this is not the whole problem. People are used to networking as a valuable business tool. The internet has made networking a viable option for everyone. There are lots of forums and business networking sites that allow business owners to share and discuss their opinions and knowledge. If you can keep a reasonable line between your personal and professional online presence, it's a good way to get the latest news from your industry, but it can never fully replace going out there and meeting people in person.
<h2>What are the benefits of networking?</h2>
Many good jobs will never get to recruiting firms, newspapers or LinkedIn. They are shared by word of mouth. And the higher the position, the more likely it is that you will never find this job advertised anywhere. It's good to know someone in an organization that can help you get in. It can only end with an interview that is always less stressful.

Like other forms of social behavior, networking has some rules too:
<ul>
 	<li><em>The first impression matters</em> - face to face, by phone or e-mail. Always try to be prominent.</li>
 	<li><em>Do not ask directly for a favor </em>- networking is not a trade fair; it's just a chance to get potentially useful information.</li>
 	<li><em>Give and take</em> - networking is a two-way exchange and not something that is free.</li>
 	<li><em>Do your homework</em> - learn about your contacts before you meet them, and maximize the opportunity.</li>
 	<li><em>Think in context</em> - try expanding your network by stepping out from your comfort zone or usual sphere of operation.</li>
 	<li><em>Patience is a virtue</em> - dedication to the networking is a marathon, not spring; do not expect to find a dream job or to close a deal after the first meeting.</li>
</ul>
[caption id=""attachment_1467"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""680""]<img class=""wp-image-1467 size-large"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1-1024x653.jpg"" alt=""networking event at cafe, build your social network, socializing"" width=""680"" height=""434"" /> We are all networking every day, even without realizing it. Networking is just purposeful, consistent socializing.[/caption]
<h2>Creating your network</h2>
While you're new to the game, you might have a lot of valuable contacts you've never even though of before:
<ul>
 	<li>old schoolmates from high school or college</li>
 	<li>distant family members</li>
 	<li>a family of your friends</li>
 	<li>your doctor, lawyer or accountant</li>
 	<li>former colleagues or superiors</li>
 	<li>club members or anyone with whom you socialize</li>
</ul>
<h2>Building a network via events</h2>
Networking meetings and conferences are a good way to build a network if you are not sure where to start. Find out why you are and what you expect from it, and make sure you have a business card that you would pass on to important contacts you will meet. Here are the most common networking events:
<h2>Breakfast Networking Event</h2>
The majority of networking events takes place in the evening. Therefore for a morning person, breakfast networking is a great way to start your day. Breakfast meetings work especially well the morning before a long day of work and meetings. We have recently co-organized two <a href=""//amcham.eventbank.cn/event/16335/"">CMO Breakfast networking events</a> with American Chamber of Commerce.
<h2>Roundtable Events</h2>
Roundtable events give you an option to meet people in small groups. Roundtables allow for open forums and discussions that, more often than not, lead to creative ideas and new directions. It's a good opportunity to make new connections in the meantime and they provide open interaction.
<h2>Women/Men Organizations</h2>
Being involved in clubs and organizations specifically designed for women or men can help you to create a relationship with individuals who could be a great referral source.
<h2>Happy Hour Networking</h2>
Networking can be really stressful. Sipping a drink while mingling with people in a relaxing atmosphere is what makes Happy Hour networking events so popular.
<h2>Professional Associations</h2>
Professional association members tend to be from one specific type of industry. The main purpose is to exchange information and ideas. This is a simple procedure for targeting key groups. No matter what industry you are in, there are always people around to learn from. Take advantage of networking events in your area that hold events on a topic directly related to your working area.
<h2>Groups on social media</h2>
The digital age of networking is a blessing for the introvert in all of us. There are a ton of networking groups and forums on LinkedIn and Facebook (most major professional groups and their local chapters also have their own LinkedIn groups) that allow relationship-building (both business and personal) on a daily basis.

[caption id=""attachment_1468"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""680""]<img class=""wp-image-1468 size-large"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2-1024x615.jpg"" alt=""networking event, follow up email, event leads, event app"" width=""680"" height=""408"" /> Following up after the event is also part of the networking.[/caption]
<h2>Follow up after the networking event</h2>
Keep track of who you've met and what you've been talking about - it makes no sense to create a network of contacts that you'll forget. After the event send people you have met a“nice to meet you” message with a mention of a topic you have discussed with the person, so you remember the context of the conversation. If the event you have attended has an <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/event-management/event-app-checklist-features-event-success/"">event app for attendees</a>, your job might be easier. Also keep in regular contact, even if you do not need anything specific at the moment. You do not want to be known as the person who only calls when in need.

1112,"How EventBank Thinks about CSR and Supports Non-Profit Organizations","<span style=""font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"">Would you work for a company you knew was not socially responsible? Or how would you feel if your employees were working under unfair labor practices or were forced to do something unethical? No company wants to be in the headlines for engaging in socially irresponsible practices... On the other hand, when a company shows social responsibility - they show that their commitment is at the heart. If people don’t trust your business, it will be very difficult for your business to get partners and sign up new customers. It is therefore important that you make careful consideration of how your business acts in relation to your mission and vision.</span>

<span style=""font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"">At EventBank, our mission is to transform the way professional communities enable and enrich relationships. Our vision is to create a world where every person and organization uses our technology to efficiently share resources and create opportunities for success. We place emphasis on developing win-win collaborations with our clients and partners, to make sure we are all better off working with each other. </span>

<h2>Making World a Better Place Step by Step</h2>
We are always looking for quality projects that are striving to make the world a better place. Dozens of charities, non-profit organizations and other institutions are using EventBank's technology to streamline their processes and increase their efficiency. Our management software leaves these organizations with more time they can use to focus on their missions. Here are some of the recent non-profit projects that are powered by EventBank’s management software where our technology was (or still is) playing a key role.
<h3>FitHearts</h3>
<a href=""https://www.eventbank.cn/event/14371/"">FitHearts (by FitFam)</a> is a sport and fitness community passionate about reducing inequalities with a vision to come together, through like-minded individuals and corporations, to raise funds and awareness for charitable causes. They believe every life is equal, and they focus on helping those in greatest need. Their mission is to mobilize and engage the world for good, and alleviate poverty and reduce inequalities through the three areas of focus: Education, Healthcare, Wellness. EventBank is the technology partner of FitHearts and helps the whole organization to collect the funds, process the registrations for the event, communicate with the donors, members, and community. We also help to distribute the funds to the charities involved.
<h3>She Loves Tech</h3>
<a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/eventbank-spotlight/eventbank-spotlight-loves-tech/"">She Loves Tech</a> is a global movement initiated by women behind Lean In China, which is another non-profit organization we are supporting. She Loves Tech showcases the convergence of the latest trends in technology, entrepreneurship, innovation and the opportunities it creates for women. This non-profit project runs completely on the EventBank's cloud platform. We helped She Loves Tech to bring women in technology together through our technology and narrow the gender gap.

<h3>Chi Fan for Charity</h3>
Through our Technology Partnership with Chi Fan for Charity, we have supported <em>Education in Sight</em>, a non-profit whose vision is the world where every rural, Chinese student has the eyeglasses he or she needs to see clearly and succeed in school. They accomplish their mission by bringing the eye exams, eyeglasses, and eye care education students need directly to their classrooms. To date, they have given over 150,000 eye exams and delivered 20,000 pairs of glasses to children in need. For last three years, we have been helping the people behind the Chi Fan for Charity to collect the funds and with check-ins at dozens of events happening simultaneously at various locations. We also helped to collect the charity to collect and distribute more than 160,000 USD. <a href=""https://chifanforcharity.org/beijing/restaurant/homeplate/"">EventBank CEO</a> has been also directly involved with the project for several years now, and few of our colleagues were also volunteering and helping with the organization of the events.

Besides these three amazing initiatives, we are working with many other non-profit organizations and partners, such as Shanghai Sunrise, Lean in, Social Supply, StartUp Grind, Startup Weekend, Black &amp; White Charity Gala and many others.

[su_box title=""You could meet us at Asia-Pacific Business Forum (APBF) 2018"" box_color=""#002959""]We were exhibiting at the <a href=""https://apbf.cyberport.hk"">Asia-Pacific Business Forum</a> (APBF) 2018, organized by the United Nations (ESCAP) in Hong Kong on April 10-11, 2018. We were talking about how our technology is helping in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).[/su_box]
<h3>United Nations Global Compact Network, Indonesia</h3>
The United Nations Global Compact Network is a global community of businesses taking shared responsibility for the creation of a better world. As a <a href=""https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission"">member</a>, EventBank not only identifies with their mission but aims to advocate for justice in matters of labor, human rights, environment, and anti-corruption. Catalyzing change is a matter of taking the lead in supporting wider goals of sustainable development, in the process proving that business can act as a force for good. Within the network, EventBank is able to collaborate with like-minded businesses and tailor their growth in the direction of good, making their membership a guiding force. Business operates best when connected to the local communities surrounding it.
<h2><span style=""font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>How Can Companies Approach CSR?</strong></span></h2>
<span style=""font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"">People today are demanding to do business with companies that make social responsibility one of their core values – and with today's communication technologies, it makes it easy for them to find out if a company acts in a socially responsible way or not. Many companies consider their work with CSR to complement the company’s business strategy and core competencies. In this way, the company creates value for the company’s stakeholders while strengthening its competitiveness and earnings. Besides that, investors and employees also prefer to interact with a company that has a firm foothold in socially responsible approaches. </span>

The world is faced with challenges in all three dimensions of sustainable development—economic, social and environmental. No matter how hard we at EventBank try, we are not able to help everybody that we would like to. But we are firm in our mission to transform the communities around the world. We want to be inclusive and take special care of the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable either directly ourselves or via our partners that we support. The way we help the world to be a better place is close cooperation with our partners and network effect that always bring us in front of new charities, NGOs and organizations that are trying to make a positive change in the world and who can do it more efficiently, in an environmentally friendly way using our EventBank technology.

[su_quote cite=""""]<span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"">Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a form of corporate self-regulation that builds sustainability and public interest into business decision-making and activities.

The winning chambers of commerce and executives were announced during the first-ever online conference for chambers in the Asia Pacific ‘<a href=""https://www.apacchamber.com/"">APAC 2018 Chambers of Commerce Online Conference’</a>.

The Awards recognize chambers’ efforts toward improving their communities during the past year. The judging committee was looking for efficient chamber operations, happy members, innovative engagement programs, events that bring value, and passionate chamber leaders who are not afraid of changes. The APAC 2018 International Chamber of Commerce Awards has seen a huge increase in the number of the applications for each category with almost every country in the Asia Pacific represented in the applications.

“We are very happy to see so many chambers in the region applying for this year’s APAC Chamber Awards. It was extremely challenging to decide on the winners as all applying chambers have achieved great results in the past year. I want to congratulate all the winners and thank every participating chamber of commerce for all the hard work they are doing for the benefit of their members,” said Eric L. Schmidt, CEO of EventBank.

[su_quote cite=""Eric L. Schmidt, CEO at EventBank""]We will continue supporting chambers of commerce not only with our chamber software but also by creating more useful content and initiatives like ‘APAC 2018 Chambers of Commerce Online Conference’ in near future.[/su_quote]

This year’s Awards included five categories and the Awards went to two nominees in three of the five categories this year. EventBank congratulates all the winners for their outstanding achievements.

<span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Siobhan Das, Executive Director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Malaysia</strong></span>

Siobhan, the superwoman of the AmCham, as described in the application, initiated MY AMCHAM CARES program to celebrate and recognize their members' CSR efforts and tenacious engagement with Ministry of International Trade and Industry and Ministry of Finance, that resulted in the Withholding Tax Exemption ruling in September last year. She also helped facilitate hosting Prime Minister at a gala dinner celebrating 60 years of the US-Malaysia business relations. She is dedicated not only to members and the chamber at large but also to her team.

<strong>Malaysian</strong><strong> Dutch Business Council</strong>

MDBC uses an iterative approach to continuously improve their member engagement. They are proactive in understanding their member’s needs and systematically test possible improvements to engage their members, and then implement the services that cater to their member’s needs. The chamber has very happy members, great renewal numbers and quite steep increase in new members with great satisfaction. One example of this is their most recent survey, where they found that business development and local talent acquisition was a difficulty for a portion of their members. Thus, they organized a Connects Fair and expanded their HR services to provide additional support.What makes MDBC different? They are unique as they allow their members a constant dialogue to express their needs or concerns. Malaysia is a country with a very intricate business environment which makes it difficult for newcomers. Using their engagement strategy, they assure their members receive relevant information to help their businesses on a consistent basis. They take the initiative to develop services upon understanding their members' needs from this dialogue. MDBC is also unique due to their pioneering member engagement strategies that no other Dutch chamber has done in the region (or other Chambers in Malaysia) such as the talent acquisition initiatives through their Student Internship Program and Spouse Program. They are constantly evolving ideas to best meet the needs of their members.

<span style=""color: black; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium;"">With an all-in-one platform, all your data is stored in one place, from your memberships to events, to your finances and marketing. All this information lives in a feedback loop, creating insightful, actionable analytics. For example, if you’re planning your next annual general meeting (AGM) and inviting all your members, you need to know about their behavior, to market effectively and sell more tickets. Using an all-in-one software, you can see the entire history <span id=""0.28625030651687555"" class=""highlight"">of</span> your communities engagement with your Chamber, like the number <span id=""0.5681388156706442"" class=""highlight"">of</span> people who came to your last AGM, what percentage <span id=""0.5928897347048323"" class=""highlight"">of</span> your members buy early-bird tickets and much more. However, if you use separate tools for your memberships and event planning you will have to manually input and merge data between them. It is not just exhausting and boring process, it is also error-prone.</span><span style=""color: black; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium;"">
</span><span style=""color: black; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium;"">
When you have an all-in-one software, everyone in your chamber will have an easier time accessing crucial data, and the various aspects <span id=""0.03251171208436543"" class=""highlight"">of</span> your planning will be kept in conversation with each other. This enables you to focus on maximizing attendance at your events and catering to your members, and as you can track every detail about your community, so you know exactly where to focus your outreach. Moreover, an all-in-one platform will save you from wasting your Chamber's funds on numerous subscriptions to a variety <span id=""0.284532826286346"" class=""highlight"">of</span> different platforms.

1349,"Event Apps: Why Your Event Needs an App and What Should it Do?","<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So your team is hard at work <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/event-planning-checklist/"">planning every aspect of your next meeting or event</a>. That’s good. You know a well-organized and executed event is one of the most impactful ways to take prospect, customer, employees, or member relationships to the next level. Prospects become customers. Members become champions. Employees become advocates. How do you get these relationships to the next level? There's an Event app for that. </span>

<div>[contact-form-7 id=""3235"" title=""freebies english""]</div>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But your audience can’t get everything they need from the event if they don’t know who else is attending. Or what’s happening when. Or any other one of countless details. There's an Event App for that.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A robust, well-designed event app can make a huge difference in how enjoyable and valuable an event is for attendees. And it’s a crucial tool to help you gather the information you need to evaluate the event, and to demonstrate its values to members, customers, vendors, and sponsors.</span>
<h2><b>Why Do You Need an App for Your Event? Because Attendees Expect it.</b></h2>
[caption id=""attachment_1442"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""680""]<img class=""wp-image-1442 size-large"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Event-App-for-Attendees-EventBank-1024x575.jpg"" alt=""Event App for Attendees - EventBank"" width=""680"" height=""382"" /> Make attendee engagement and networking easier - even for attendees who don't like to socialize much - by offering an event app.[/caption]

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sit outside the doors of any major meeting, expo or event and watch what happens to that huge stack of printed show guides. Probably not a lot. That’s because your attendees don’t want to be weighed down throughout the day with maps, schedules, vendor flyers and more.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A well-designed meeting app delivers everything a show guide does on the one tool every attendee has - their mobile phone. By delivering everything your attendees want and need with a screen tap, you make it easier and more intuitive for them to be a part of the event. Your attendees expect to be wowed, but they also expect their time to be respected. The right event app delivers.</span>
<h2><b>What Must Your Event App Do?</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That’s easy. Everything! </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Beginning with the first invitation or email marketing contact you make through agenda to post-event download of session documents, your app can serve as your event’s brand-consistent, always accurate information hub. Here are some key functionalities to look for:</span>
<h4><b>Registration</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your website and email marketing are already hard at work selling attendees on your next event. Encouraging recipients to download your app for quick and easy registration closes the gap between intention and action.  </span>
<h4><b>Accepting Mobile Payments</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By the end of 2017, </span><a href=""//www.statista.com/statistics/252621/share-of-us-retail-e-commerce-dollars-spent-via-mobile-device/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">24 percent of all e-commerce dollars</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> were spent from mobile platforms. And that percentage grows with every passing quarter.  If your attendees can apply for a mortgage from their phones, they expect to be able to pay for a meeting or event the same way. Be sure your event app makes paying for the event easier and more frictionless by accepting secure payments by credit cards, bank transfers, and other forms of digital payments. </span>
<h4><b>Ticketing &amp; Credentialing</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Event apps speed up arrival, entry and traffic flow by delivering info-rich QR codes on show badges, tickets, and other credentials straight to your attendees’ mobile devices. Scan their phone (perhaps with an <a href=""//www.eventbank.com/platform/eventbank-manager-app-organizer"">event app for organizers</a>) at the check-ins and they’re on the floor in no time flat.</span>
<h4><b>Scheduling</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Easy-to-use, interactive schedules show attendees what’s happening when (and where). Built-in links, QR codes, and relevant community information encourage attendance and promotion, along with up-to-the-minute time and place updates. Too, app-based schedules make it easier for you to publish agendas to the people who need them most.</span>
<h4><b>Floorplans and Mapping</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The bigger your event, the greater the possibility that attendees will get lost, misdirected or delayed. Working with your venue, you can embed everything from simple floor plans to 360° views of your event in your app, making it a valuable resource throughout the day.</span>
<h4><b>Attendee Directories</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Event apps integrate data from registrations, CRM, or membership directories to make it quick and easy for attendees to find colleagues, contact each other for meetings, and keep track of needed follow-ups.  Pocket full of business cards, you’ve met your match.</span>
<h4><b>Social Sharing</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">From selfies and check-in to LinkedIn profile checks, event apps with deep social integration help spread the impact and excitement beyond the venue.</span>
<h4><b>Info Sharing</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Why wait for an email when you get back to the office? Your event app can make decks, presentations, videos, notes, research, transcripts, and more available from your app as they become available.</span>
<h4><b>Optimized Online Experiences</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Advances in responsive websites and mobile-first design can extend the power and value of your website. Which means in addition to all of the content you deliver straight to your attendee’s phones, you can use an event app to point users to your organization’s or event’s complete website.</span>

[caption id=""attachment_1436"" align=""alignright"" width=""248""]<a href=""//www.eventbank.com/platform/mobile-apps/eventbank-app-attendee-members""><img class=""wp-image-1436"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/phones-membership-with-icon@2x-183x300.png"" alt=""QR code check-ins, event registration, event app, attendee mobile app, scheduling, documents"" width=""248"" height=""407"" /></a> Allow your community members and event attendees to engage and receive important information from anywhere.[/caption]
<h4><b>Deeper Sponsor/Vendor/Exhibitor Involvement</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You’ve worked hard to build relationships with relevant sponsors. They do more than help pay for your event; they bring the new products and ideas your attendees expect. Event apps take exhibitor directories and events to the next level. Detailed information, show locations, links, promotions, VIP events and more create a richer, more connected experience for your sponsors.</span>
<h4><strong>Featuring All Your Events</strong></h4>
Your event app should last you longer than just one event. The best mobile apps work for all your events, so all the events you organize are available for attendees inside the app. This way, they can easily discover and register for all your events in a few taps, and the app works as another marketing channel that helps you get more attendees.
<h4><strong>Integrated with Your Event Management Software</strong></h4>
All your event marketing materials such as event pages, invitations, event app itself, tickets and other materials should be aligned so your branding is consistent. Event organizers are notoriously busy people running on tight schedules. By having your event app integrated with your event management software, you not only save hours of error-prone copying and pasting the content, but also a significant amount of money. For example, our <a href=""//www.eventbank.com/solutions/event-marketing-management-cloud"">Event Management Cloud</a> comes with <a href=""//www.eventbank.com/platform/mobile-apps/eventbank-app-attendee-members"">EventBank Attendee App</a> and an <a href=""//www.eventbank.com/platform/eventbank-manager-app-organizer"">EventBank Manager App</a> for event organizers included.
<h2><b>Event Apps Deliver Insights and Awareness</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Events and meetings represent a substantial investment of time and money. How can you know if the effort was worth it? </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Event apps can help by providing real-time analytics.  Who’s attending what events? What does the daily financial picture look like? Are membership renewals growing or declining? Event apps allow your organization to gather hundreds of valuable data points and integrate them into your membership or CRM systems. If you feed this data into compatible </span><a href=""//technologyadvice.com/business-intelligence/?utm_source=eventbank&amp;utm_medium=guestblog&amp;utm_content=plan_event_success&amp;utm_term=buyer&amp;utm_campaign=link-building""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">business intelligence (BI) software</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, your team can watch event statistics on a dashboard in the home office in real-time. With the right app in place, you get instant insight and direction more easily than ever before.</span>

[caption id=""attachment_1440"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""651""]<img class=""wp-image-1440"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/facebookevent6-300x200.jpg"" alt=""attendee engagement, event app for onsite networking, event management software, EventBank"" width=""651"" height=""434"" /> Networking at events via an event app can be addictive.[/caption]
<h2><b>Your event is branding, and so is your app</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">From intimate VIP get-togethers to city-wide, multi-week mega-happenings, events often represent the high point of your brand’s year. Your customers or members expect to be informed and entertained, of course. But they expect to be wowed, too. That’s because events represent a physical, experiential embodiment of what your brand stands for. It’s why you make considerable investments in event design and production. And it’s why planning for next year’s event probably begins the day after this year’s.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Well-designed event applications give you another powerful tool to create and maintain relationships with your audience by extending the brand experience, and by delivering all of the content and knowledge you’ve worked so hard to present.</span>
<h2><b>Kiss The Bad Old Days Goodbye</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Events used to happen through hard work, a great team and countless spreadsheets.  Lists, schedules, directories, seating charts, floorplans--every critical detail of an event seemed to be relegated to a tool originally built to handle the bookkeeping.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Today, event apps are powerful enough to handle dozens of member or customer activities, gather meaningful, actionable data, and then feed it back into your existing systems and processes. They’re your organization’s opportunity to change the paradigm of event planning and execution from one of list management and frantic effort to one where you spend your energy, and your team’s, creating memorable, valuable experiences for your audience. </span>

1464,"How to organize networking events","<h4>Effective Communication</h4>
The first contact with the attendees will begin after their registration, a welcoming email will directly give you their interest and make a personal connection with them. How to communicate that information effectively is much more important, though. Beyond announcing information, you should engage attendees and get them involved in your event as much as possible. Email marketing is also a useful way to get more attendees. After incorporated social media into your marketing strategy, make sure to promote your hashtag. These include your event website, promotional emails and more. Don't forget to announce the event few weeks in advance.

Venue
Choosing the right venue for your networking event is one of the most important decisions you will need to make.  It’s important to find a space that accommodates, easy to find and respect the schedule of everyone. For a business event, you need a professional environment, and that means a hired venue or banquet hall. Make sure that the venue is able to offer a greater flexibility with great customer service when it comes to hosting the attendees. It's better if the staff know your event schedule and timing.

What kind of networking event should I run?
After you have identified your networking goals, it's time to choose in the right networking events.

Check-in &amp; Name Badging
Nowadays, hosting an event with a lot of people, the manual check-in and badge printing can be a stressful process for both organizers and attendees. Using QR or bar codes to ensure small lines and a great start to every event.The most important things is to deliver an outstanding attendee experience. Make things easier using for instance online check-in. Name badges are  also really important at events where networking is the main concern. Name badges make acquaintances easily, and in much faster time as there is less of a need for introductions. The name badge serves as a reminder, and helps avoid any potential missteps. Having essential identifying information ‘at hand’ at the right time can open the door for opportunities, and provide a platform for your guests to impress and spark interaction and the chance to your guest to expand a business work.",,1970-01-01,post,http://blog.eventbank.com/?p=1464,,,,,,,,Uncategorized,,English,,draft,5,Eric,eric@eventbank.com,"Eric L.",Schmidt,,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-05-10
1496,"How NU SKIN Used EventBank for a Global Conference with 7,000 Attendees","Last August, <a href=""//www.nuskin.com/nuskin.html"">NU SKIN,</a> a leading global personal care product company from North America, successfully managed its NU SKIN Global Annual Conference at the Sheraton Grand Hotel in Macau using <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/event-management/trends-in-event-management-2018/"">EventBank’s Event Management Software</a>.

Though incredibly successful in the end, the organizers of the conference were up to many challenges in planning and operating this conference of nearly 7,000 people.

These challenges caused the organizers to consider many different aspects of the event.

In doing so, they asked themselves:
<h3>Roles &amp; Permissions</h3>
How do we ensure the security of our data by granting only limited access to our temporary staff and volunteers?
<h3>Congestion</h3>
How do we avoid congestion and effectively manage the traffic at multiple check-in locations?
<h3>Real-time Monitoring</h3>
How do we monitor attendees’ behavior in real-time over all aspects of the conference, such as material collection, information inquiry, dining, and other specific data?
<h3>Reduce Losses</h3>
How do we effectively prevent attendees from getting multiple meals, non-participants from entering the conference, and other harmful activities from occurring?
<h3>Collecting and Processing Data</h3>
How do we collect all of our attendee's information, including their interactions, and then effectively process this data?
<h2>How did the EventBank’s Event Management Software help solve NU SKIN's challenges?</h2>
NU SKIN created different types of tickets for attendees with different conditions during their pre-event preparations. Each ticket had different access rights so as to encourage participants to register according to their actual conditions and to purchase different tickets accordingly. NU SKIN also created different roles and permissions for their team; for example, volunteers who were assisting with check-ins were only able to access check-in tools.

<strong>✅ Roles &amp; Permissions Challenge Solved</strong>

After attendees successfully registered, the EventBank system generated a personal two-dimensional QR code which was delivered to attendees automatically via email and conveniently accessible through the EventBank App. This made check-ins very convenient for the staff, who could easily review attendees and see the progress and traffic of check-in at each of 20 different check-in locations.

<strong>✅ Congestion Challenge Solved</strong>

After setting up tables and follow the <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/planning-events-growth-guide/"">best practices</a> of running a registration at the door, NU SKIN successfully kept congestion out of sight and conference wait time down to a minimum.
<p class=""r""><strong>✅ Losses Minimalized </strong></p>


[caption id=""attachment_1569"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""527""]<img class=""wp-image-1569 "" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NI-Skin-Global-Conference-Using-EventBank-300x178.png"" alt=""NU Skin Global Conference Using EventBank, case study, event management software"" width=""527"" height=""313"" /> NU SKIN's volunteers are ready to check people in using EventBank Manager app![/caption]

At the same time, NU SKIN's managers and volunteers could monitor the data of each check-in location in real-time through the EventBank Manager app. This helped their team to understand every attendee’s event journey. The organizer could also oversee on-site traffic and avoid congestions at their multiple check-in locations such as at the dining hall, thus reducing the costs further.

<strong>✅ Real-time Monitoring</strong>

Organizers could not only monitor the progress of the event in the real-time but could also easily export data for each attendee and perform in-depth analysis of their data after the event. In this way, they could understand the behavior of the attendees and improve the organization of the next event. Organizers could also send follow-up (thank you) emails to attendees after the event, thanking them for their attendance and informing them of other events they are planning or sharing the presentation directly from the EventBank platform.

<strong>✅ Collecting and Processing Data</strong>

By simply being on the EventBank platform, NU SKIN was able to not only collect and grow their list of attendees, contacts, and even leads, but they were also able to update current attendee information as well. Being able to track the mere fact that a contact had registered for the event gives NU SKIN a sincere form on insight that is often looked over.

Further more with the finance and web hosting modules on EventBank's platform, NU SKIN can not only offer ticketing online, but has been able to track and analyze metrics from sales, ticketing, registration and more.

1524,"How to Calculate Event ROI - A Cheat Sheet","How do you determine if your event was successful? By the number of attendees, sales generated or connections that you built? Or you may bring up the concept of ROI. Unlike ROI for a portfolio or real estate investment, event ROI is a bit more complicated as there are many intangible assets that you may want to take into consideration. We all know that you have put a lot of effort into your events. So in order to see if your hard work has paid off, we definitely need to understand event ROI and the calculation behind the concept.

<strong>[su_box title=""What is ROI?"" box_color=""#00b832""]</strong>ROI stands for return on investment. It measures and evaluates the efficiency of an investment (in this case, an event). There are several ways to calculate the ROI. We will discuss each way later in details.<strong>[/su_box]</strong>
<h2>Objectives of Events</h2>
Different kinds of events have their own objectives. Before calculating the ROI, there should be a clear picture of the purpose and goal of the event. Ideally, there should be one primary objective and several secondary objectives. For example, if your event's purpose is to introduce the new product of your firm, then the primary objective might be to generate media awareness. The secondary objectives can be to increase website traffic and build connections.

<h2>Tracking Marketing Attribution</h2>
There are six marketing attribution models that can help you figure out your event’s ROI. Three of them are single source attribution and the other three are under the multi-source attribution category.
<h3><em>Single Source Attribution</em></h3>
<h4>First Touch Model</h4>
The First Touch Model attributes all the credit to the first marketing channel that drives someone to your website or to have some interaction with your company. For example, If someone reads a post about your event on Facebook and checks out your website, then the post is considered as the first touch. It is simple to understand in theory but can be biased.
<h4>Lead Conversion Touch Model</h4>
The Lead Conversion Touch Model gives all the credit to the first marketing channel that generates the lead. We continue with the previous example, after visiting your website, the person decides to attend your event. Then your website is considered as the lead conversion touch. This model is easy to track and implement. However, it ignores all the actions that happened before the lead was generated.
<h4>Final Touch Model</h4>
The Final Touch Model gives all the credit to the last marketing channel before the final sale. For example, if the customer purchased your product right after talking to the sales representative, then sales representative is considered as the final touch point. This model is probably the easiest model to implement since we are finding the last action that takes place before one becomes a customer. However, like the previous models, it ignores what happen during the rest of the marketing process and is therefore biased.
<h3><em>Multi-Source Attribution </em></h3>
<h4>W-shaped model</h4>
The W-shaped model gives credits to all marketing channels. The distribution depends on the marketers, but usually the three key points: the first touch, lead conversion, and last touch each receive 30% credit, and the remaining 10% is divided among the marketing channels that occurred between the first touch and the last touch.
<h4>U-shaped model</h4>
The U-shaped model gives credits to the first touch, the lead conversion touch, and every channel in between. The first touch and lead conversion touch each receive 40%, and the other channels share 10%.
<h4>Linear Attribution Model</h4>
The Linear Attribution is the simplest multi-source attribution model. It gives equal weight to every marketing channel. Although it is easy to implement, it ignores the fact that different touch points might have varying impact.
<h2><strong>Calculating Event ROI</strong></h2>
There are three ways in calculating Event ROI.

<img class=""wp-image-1556 aligncenter"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Group-7@2x-300x56.png"" alt=""event ROI"" width=""461"" height=""86"" />

Let’s look closer at the equation. One way to calculate revenue that is generated directly from the event is to use the number of leads * likelihood of closing * average size of the deal. However, event revenue does not only include the money a firm makes from an event. The followings should also be taken into consideration: pipeline value, media coverage, attendees, connections, sponsorships, data collected, and brand image building.

The event expenses include but are not limited to travel expense of organizer's team, paid promotion (social media campaigns, PPCs, KOL marketing), venue, labor, refreshments, stationery, and event-related technology.

<img class="" wp-image-1558 aligncenter"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Group-101212@2x-300x64.png"" alt=""event ROI"" width=""469"" height=""100"" />

We can also find the event ROI by first calculating the event profit, which equals to event revenue minus event expenses. Then we divide the event profit by event expenses to get the ROI.

<img class="" wp-image-1557 aligncenter"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/imgo-300x86.jpg"" alt=""event ROI"" width=""471"" height=""135"" />

We can use gross margin instead of event revenue to calculate the event ROI. Gross margin is found by subtracting the cost of goods sold from event revenue. Cost of goods (services) sold is the direct cost of producing goods or providing services.
<h2><strong>Event ROI with EventBank</strong></h2>
So, where does EventBank fit into your event ROI equation?

In order to calculate the ROI, you would need tools to collect and analyze data. EventBank helps here as we have an integrated P&amp;L calculator that automatically records revenue from the sold tickets and you can also add any kind of cost and revenue in the platform. Moreover, sponsorship value can be added on a proportional basis (e.g. using only 10% of the annual sponsorship for one of your events). With a strong CRM system, the EventBank platform allows you to keep track of attendees and assess the marketing attribution base on the model you choose to use.

<img class=""size-medium wp-image-1525 aligncenter"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/crm@2x-300x288.png"" alt="""" />

EventBank helps to increase your ROI by both reducing expenses and increasing revenue. The platform has multiple promotional tools such as professional invitations, automated reminders, and notifications, QR codes for social media sharing and more.

2020,"How to Select New Software for Your Organization?","As a small organization, you can work more or less on paper or in Google Spreadsheets or Excel.  At least until a certain time.

As the business grows, the records database grows, the processes get more complex, and you and your colleagues might not be working from the same office anymore. You suddenly realize that the information you are passing on is getting diverted or lost somewhere along the way. The number of people no longer allows having a simple and quick overview of who is working on what and what tasks are assigned to who.

And so you say it's time to get an app or software into your business to help you. Or the impulse comes from someone in your team who wants to have an order in their activities.

Different CRM applications and project management are inexhaustible. Simple testing of free trials soon paralyzes you and you do not choose any of the options. Or, without a depper though, you accept the design of your employee who ""worked with this software in the past and said it was great."" But you do not even know if this software suits your business. In addition, you leave the employee alone to push the software in your organization, which usually does not work because other colleagues have no incentive to accept the new system.

But is not it a pity? A systematic approach to selection will help you get over the critical ""sea of options"" and narrow your selection.
<h2>Even the longest journey begins with the first step.</h2>
<h3>1) Clearly define what you expect from the software</h3>
This is the first and absolutely essential step. If you know in which areas your work is scrubbing, it is up to you, the owner, to talk to people. Ask what they need to make it easier for them to work. Please take their answers into the selection criteria. Choose the typical projects and situations you are addressing in the company and want to get from the new software. How do you work with them now? How do you want to work with them in the future to make it easier for you to work and increase efficiency? Who's going into them?

Write down the features you need and that would be cool but not critical to you. Is it time tracking because you need to assign time to specific projects and orders? Do you also need to get project / contract costs there? Do you need to assign tasks to each other? Have the opportunity to invite external collaborators? Do you need to record an engagement cycle in your system? Do you need to get documents and diversify access to specific users? Do you need to get the entire company or just individual projects into the system? Do you want to move the communication or just the organization of events? Do you need a calendar link? Need a mobile app? etc. There are many requirements for these requirements.

The key is to get the most concrete idea before you go into search.

Maybe it sounds trivial, but a lot of clients I meet first head out into the sea with only the dim vision of what they want, and when they deal with details over time. They mostly freeze to use each application for a while and then say they do not like it. And they're looking for it. And he still does not know what.

If you do not know where to start and how to organize your requirements, you can use a check-list from the FreeL guys by which they help their clients choose the right application:

What business processes and activities do you need to get into the new system?
How do you solve these processes and activities now - do you already use any system?
What problem do you need to resolve with the new system? What do you expect from him?
What features are essential for you?
What features are good, but can you walk around without them?
Who will work with the new system and what are their computer and language skills?
Do you need to link the new system to existing software?
What is your budget?
How quickly do you need a new system?
Checklist in PDF format HERE to download.

Relax your team and clarify why you are going to change.
2) Assemble by specifying the budget and considering the timeframe
If you have defined that you want ""software / application to do it and it"", step two is to build a team. Identify the person who will solve the project - the solver. Give him a budget (a good first filter to choose) and timeouts (do you need an application right now, or can you afford to wait for half a year?). Select from each team one person to whom the new software will be related. The one who will defend the demands and give incentives behind it.

Whoever looks, finds 🙂
3) Search and test
If you have a clear set of requirements for the main person who solves the new software project, it's time to start looking. Start by asking your colleagues and those familiar in the field to solve similar needs. Other will be for social services, others in construction or software developers, others will be for freelancers, etc. The easiest research you make in your neighborhood.

As the second one, read the Internet, a variety of applications that resolve similar needs will come under your keywords.

If it's Czech software, try to talk to developers or their business associate and discuss your needs specifically - does the application know? how does it work with?

If it is not, you have to test it. Every similar application typically allows the full-time test period. Prepare your model situations, join the entire ""search"" team. Try, test, discover. This phase is probably the most demanding, but non-payment. Use real situations, best to see if it brings you what you need.

Some apps will be discarded right away, some later, some of your favorites will remain.

You will most likely find that you do not get all your requirements into any of the market applications, let alone the way you imagine.

Then you have two choices - choose the one that meets your requirements the most and for the rest of the requirements to compromise or resolve them differently. Or, let the program be tailor-made to customize any existing ones. There, however, count on a much larger investment, both financial and time.

When making selection criteria, be careful to keep the requirements of individuals within limits. It can easily happen that, under the weight of individual requirements and the desire to satisfy everyone, you will introduce a complex system that no one wants to use. Ask colleagues, collect their demands. Oh yes. But filter them, work with them and have a simple and clear application at the end. This is one of the cornerstones of success.

And if you are not sure whether you are taking into account all the important things, and if you do not forget something, you do not have to pay for a consultation from someone who has a well-mapped market and offer and can advise you how best to meet your needs. External and independent consultants usually have a very good overview of each application's comparison, and an hour or two consultation can save you quite a bit of time.

The right decision always precedes honest collection of information.

4) Decide
The decision should be consensual among all members of the selection team. Discuss, argue, go back to testing model situations. But it is important that the final decision be adopted by all. In order to be successful in a company, you need to have people who believe it and are worth it.

How to avoid reactions like: ""what have we made up for us, will it be extra work, it will be complicated, complicated and useless ...""?

In this competitive environment, professionals know that in order to be successful they need to CONNECT with the people. Entrepreneurs, organizations, and associations host events for that exact reason. Networking is a NECESSITY in the professional world, especially in China where relationships are the key to future opportunities. However, managing successful events in China can be difficult for Western and Chinese companies alike.

Event and association management software providers hold the key to making your event managing experience successful, but with so many providers to choose from, how do you pick the best one to help you run successful events in China? Which event management software for events in China is the most equipped to serve both Western and Chinese clientele? Which provider will help you take advantage of your business opportunities in the Chinese market?

EventBank's all-in-one solutions are the leader in helping Western and Chinese companies manage successful events and memberships. Our platform is optimal for navigating the complicated yet lucrative Chinese market.
<h2 id=""china""><b>Why should you choose EventBank when doing business in China?</b></h2>
In what ways is the EventBank platform the best option for managing events in China when compared to other Western and Chinese alternatives? Good question.
<h3>Company Structure</h3>
In a business world that seems to be split between the Western and Eastern schools of practice, EventBank operates as a perfect hybrid of both - a strong bridge connecting both worlds. Founded in 2013 by two entrepreneurs, a Chinese and an American, EventBank understands the nuances of the Chinese market. In fact we have two offices in China, in the largest Chinese cities Beijing and Shanghai. Our diverse management proves to be a benefit to us as we are cognizant of how our clients, whether Chinese or Western, would prefer to do business. We seek to make the client's experience the best it can possibly be!
<h3>EventBank's Partners in China</h3>
We have partnered with a multitude of outstanding corporates, community organizations, and investors. With the help of our partners, we have access to a greater network of resources in China to support our clients. Our clients don't have to start from ground zero when entering the Chinese market; we have the network to propel them into a bright future! The Chinese market is, therefore, much more navigable for all of our clients as a result of our company structure. Most competitors of EventBank do not have the benefit of operating under a hybrid model with so many Chinese and Western partners. Clients of these companies tend to find that adapting to the Chinese market proves to be inconvenient, expensive, and time-consuming.

<h2 id=""vschina"">Managing Events in China Vs. Everywhere Else</h2>
From a broad standpoint, running and managing events with the help of software <em>should</em> be the same everywhere around the world.

We say it should, but that just isn't the case.

China is a one of a kind market, not just for events, but for really any industry. Smartphones run the country, and these days in China you'd be hard pressed to find any local walking around with wallet, keys, and a phone. For the most part of big city life in China, all you need is a smart phone.

In China, your phone unlocks your door, starts your car, charges your metro ride, unlocks bicycles, holds all your tickets, and this is just scratching the surface. So naturally this translates to events quite well.

Chinese events hardly ever have physical sign in sheets at the front gates of the event. Everything is done on the phone, and most notably, there's rarely a need for adoption of third party apps, as most events will run some sort of registration process on WeChat, the app that took China by storm, and is responsible for a majority of all digital actions that happen daily for each person.

Digital ticketing and registration in the US for instance, never really caught on, as western and other foreign market consumers rarely add more apps to their phone. Converting a consumer to download your event app is a hard thing to sell due to insecurities, annoyances and fear of bloating their phone with too many apps with access to their system.

In China however, leveraging WeChat is the best way to achieve true digital conversion of the masses at large. Furthermore, a typical chinese national has little notions about digital security and privacy concerns like their counterparts abroad, and therefore more likely to download apps left and right to ease their offline-to-online interactions in their daily lives.

This is why EventBank leverages it's EventBank mobile apps, so help register, ticket and keep informed attendees for your events. Everything is easy to use, and fits comfortable with both international payment schemes, and Chinese payment tools like TenPay, Alipay, and WeChat.
<h2 id=""servers"">Operating off of the Chinese server (.cn)</h2>
As an international event &amp; association management software provider, EventBank operates its platform on three different servers: .com, .ru, and .cn. Having access to the Chinese server means that we can run our business on Chinese internet channels; we don't have to resort to operating on another international server while trying to invest in the Chinese market. There are many benefits that come from this such as:
<h3>Faster Service</h3>
In the tech industry, speed is money.

The quicker and more effectively a tech company can deliver a product to their customer, the more business the company can conduct. The Chinese server decreases the time it takes for us to get our customers onto their new websites, event pages, and membership management systems. If we were to operate on non-Chinese servers in China like some other Western providers do, it would take your attendees much longer to register for the event and receive all the communication.
<h3>Localized Payment Options for Events in China</h3>
If you have been to China, you would know that payment options in China are SO different than those in the Western world. Cash and credit cards are obsolete; mobile payment options are necessities. The convenience of having unlimited access to all of your financial resources on your phone and never having to carry a physical wallet is very attractive to the vast majority of Chinese citizens. In a recent <a href=""//www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/publication/documents/2017-08/Mobile_payments_in_China-2017.pdf"">report</a>, 74% said they would be okay with carrying less than 100 RMB (15 USD) in their wallets for more than a month. With statistics like this, it is clear that EventBank needed to offer a platform that is capable of integrating with popular mobile payment options.

Our platform accepts WeChat Pay, AliPay, and UnionPay - three most popular payment methods in China. In doing so, we have allowed our customers to pay for our services however they prefer. Within the WeChat integration, specifically, EventBank has also installed a WeChat login feature. Clients no longer have to have a separate password and email in order to access our platform. They can do it by simply logging onto one of the most popular apps in the world. In working with popular Western alternatives to EventBank, it is almost impossible to use mobile payment options when doing business, especially the Chinese payment platforms. Western companies don't see a demand for these sorts of integration in their main markets and, because they don't have a connection with the Chinese market, don't think to offer it when promoting their products internationally.

<h3><b>Is access to the Chinese server really necessary to do business in China?</b></h3>
Like all other countries in the world, China has its own regulations governing society, including rules governing cyber-activity. EVERY company that wants to do business in China via the internet needs to be officially verified by the Chinese government. In verifying a company website, you are ensuring your company's ability to do secure, consistent business with your clients in China, with no fear of being shut down. At EventBank, we believe this is a security all clients should be entitled to!

Further, while it is advantageous to operate on the Chinese server when doing business in China, it is also ILLEGAL not to! Popular Western alternatives are in direct violation of Chinese cybersecurity laws when they operate on foreign servers (.com) in China. These companies run the risk of being blocked, which would be unfortunate for not only the company but also the company's clients. Why don't all companies just get verified? Another good question. In order to be verified, the company must have some sort of dedicated space in China, which could prove to be an expensive expansionary strategy. Therefore, most popular Western alternatives choose not to make the venture into China but choose to operate outside of Chinese cybersecurity laws.

[su_box title=""What is China Cyber Security Law? "" box_color=""#002959""]China's Cyber Security Law is the Chinese government’s attempt to regulate the internet within its borders. The law (commenced on June 1, 2017) requires companies doing business in China (such as organizing events) to store their (China-related) data on Chinese-law regulated local servers.[/su_box]

EventBank, as an officially verified and registered entity, is equipped to provide a quality, secure service in China that is unmatched by any other popular Western alternative attempting to do business from outside of China.
<h2 id=""cs""><b>Adaptable Customer Success Team</b></h2>
There are many reasons to choose EventBank as your management software provider in China but one of our company's strongest assets is our incredible staff, specifically our Customer Success Team. Customer Succes Team is made up of many individuals of varying nationalities, skilled in speaking many global languages including Chinese. When doing business in China, it is extremely helpful to have someone to answer questions if you ever were to run into any problems - someone who is familiar with both your preferred language and that of the land. This is where our Customer Success colleagues come in handy. You don't have to wait for someone across the world to answer a generic email. We have people ready to answer your questions, no matter the difficulty when you need it.
<h3>On-site Support at Events in China</h3>
<figure><img class=""alignnone"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/imgo-2.jpg"" alt=""event management software for events in China, WHO event in China, EventBank software"" width=""1205"" height=""803"" /><figcaption>EventBank team members utilizing the mobile check-in features while assisting with registration at a WHO event in Beijing.</figcaption></figure>
Have you ever thought ""if somebody were working with me to help solve this problem or run this event in China, it would be much easier?"" We've thought that too. As a company with a strong presence in China, we have the opportunity to assist our customer with their events in China. We are known for going to our clients and demonstrating our product when they are experiencing issues.

Our clients frequently ask us to assist them in managing their events and, as a result, we have had the opportunity to make many memories, in many places. Our Western competitors not based in China do not have the opportunity to serve their clients in these ways. Clients of these companies often have to wait at least a day to have their questions answered, proving to be a waste of valuable time that many professionals can't afford. EventBank has valued its client's time for the past 5 years and will continue to value its clients' time for as long as we are in business.
<h2 id=""invoicing""><b>Invoicing in China aka Fapiao Management</b></h2>
EventBank has developed the entirety of its product based on the needs of its clients. As we continue to do a large amount of work in China, we will continue to do so to help our Chinese clients manage their business. Our fapiao feature allows Chinese companies to collect information needed for fapiao generation, as required by Chinese tax law. This feature is very convenient. Instead of having to collect all of their customer's data manually, our clients can just download the data inputs from our system and generate invoices automatically.

Popular Western alternatives to EventBank do not have this service as they are not familiar with Chinese lifestyle let alone Chinese tax regulations. This feature, though not a necessity, is very convenient when companies need to file their annual taxes.

2043,"4 Member Engagement Best Practices to use","Member engagement is crucial for chambers of commerce and associations alike. Active members make your events more engaging and help to introduce new members. Payal Kanwar from the Indo-French Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IFCCI) has shared her insights on the best practices of member engagement with us. Some of the tools to improve member engagement are business support services, publications, events, and sector committees.
<h2>Events</h2>
There are different types of events that a chamber of commerce can organize, however, the methodology behind these events should be the same: the topic should be related to the interests of your members. For example, laws and regulations change constantly in India so events related to updates on legislation are necessary. In order to understand the expectations of members, chambers of commerce can conduct surveys.

[caption id=""attachment_2073"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""689""]<img class=""wp-image-2073 "" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2.pic_hd-380x253.jpg"" alt=""member engagement, event networking, CMO Breakfast AmCham China"" width=""689"" height=""459"" /> Event is one of the tools to improve member engagement[/caption]

&nbsp;

Moreover, chambers of commerce should provide speaking and networking opportunities for their members at the events. Besides learning about relevant information in the industry, members also need the opportunities to promote their companies and products, and to expand their network. It would be even more helpful if chambers could facilitate post-event introductions that connect their members with other members that they would like to reach out to.

[caption id=""attachment_2075"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""689""]<img class=""wp-image-2075 "" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/4.pic_hd-380x253.jpg"" alt=""member engagement; PwC Leader's Quest at EventBank, event check-in"" width=""689"" height=""459"" /> Members also need speaking and networking opportunities at the events[/caption]

&nbsp;

Facilitating contacts between companies and government is also an important way to improve member engagement. Since each industry has its own needs and challenges, chambers can organize conferences for members and government officials based on their industry. Publishing white paper is another way to provide advocacy support to members and assist them with the local government. In the white paper, chambers can state their members’ challenges and provide recommendations to the government. In the case of IFCCI, some of their recommendations actually led to the change of policies.
<h2>Sector Committees</h2>
For large chambers, it is a good idea to have sector committees. As mentioned above, each industry has its own interests and challenges. Sector committees can provide a sense of belonging to members as they are all in the same industry. It would also make networking and knowledge sharing more efficient.
<h2>Publications</h2>
Last but not least, a publication can serve as a great tool to improve member engagement. It allows chambers to publish articles to provide relevant information and market updates to their members. Members can also post advertisements to promote their companies and products.

[caption id=""attachment_2077"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""702""]<img class=""wp-image-2077 "" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/members-directory-380x256.gif"" alt=""member directory of IFCCI, member engagement best practices"" width=""702"" height=""473"" /> Member's Directory 2016-2017 (IFCCI)[/caption]

Member engagement can be complicated and challenging, especially for international chambers of commerce since the expatriate members in these organizations come and go, but we hope the ideas and insights that we shared in this article can help you to build an active, engaging, and caring community.

2126,"How to Plan and Manage a Sustainable Event","Everyone’s going green! From car manufacturers like Honda to clothing chains like H&amp;M, more and more companies are committing themselves to eco-friendly practices in their business operations. It is important to note that the motivations for adopting these practices are not merely environmental but also corporate. In today’s age of the “<a href=""//medium.com/we-learn-we-grow/lets-define-conscious-living-for-the-21st-century-336fcba332dc""><u>conscious consumer</u></a>,” if a company wants to stay relevant and successful in its market, then it must fulfill its social responsibilities, one of which is to protect the planet. In other words, a green business is a profitable business. The event industry is no exception to this trend.

According to a <a href=""//meetgreen.com/resources/meetgreen-tips/green-meeting/""><u>MeetGreen report</u></a>, a typical five-day conference with 2,500 attendees will consume up to 62,500 plates, 87,500 napkins, 75,000 cups or glasses and 90,000 cans or bottles. That is a lot of waste! For leaving such a large carbon footprint, the event industry has an equally large responsibility to fulfill. Fortunately, the process has already begun; many businesses within the industry have become already aware of their negative impacts on the environment and have started to take action. This action comes in the form of what is called <b>sustainable event management (SEM)</b>.

As its name implies, SEM is the integration of environmental concerns into the event planning process. The execution of SEM depends on various industry standards that measure the sustainability of your event (<a href=""//www.eventscouncil.org/APEX/APEXASTM.aspx""><u>APEX/ASTM</u></a>; <a href=""//www.iso.org/iso-20121-sustainable-events.html""><u>ISO 20121</u></a>; <a href=""//www.globalreporting.org/resourcelibrary/G3-1-English-Event-Organizers-Sector-Supplement-Summary%20Guide-Quick-Reference-Sheet.pdf""><u>GRI EOSS</u></a>).

Here, it is important to note that each set of standards targets a different stage in the planning process, so they are not mutually exclusive but complementary. At this point, perhaps you’re thinking, <i>it’s</i> <i>impossible for an event to be both green and cost-effective</i>. Untrue. Going green will not only reduce your company’s carbon footprint but also attract more attendees to your events, thus increasing your <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/event-management/understanding-and-calculating-event-roi-with-eventbank/""><u>event ROI</u></a>. As stated previously, in today’s society, a green business is a profitable business.

Here at EventBank, we believe that it is part of our responsibility as a member of the event industry to take environmentally conscious actions, as well as encourage others to do the same.  Thus, we have identified the following five steps to help you and your company become eco-minded event planners and meet industry green standards:
<h3><b>1. Educate yourself on sustainability</b></h3>
How can you talk sustainability when you don’t know sustainability? Before anything else, educate yourself on green terminology. For example, biodegradable is not the same as compostable, which is not the same as recyclable. It may feel like too much unnecessary jargon at first, but having a good grasp on these terms will allow you to better plan and manage eco-friendly events in the future.
<h3><b>2. Identify impact areas</b></h3>
<b> </b>Don’t forget the past; learn from it. Identify impact areas (e.g. food waste) from your past events and pick one or two to tackle for your future events. You perhaps may want to start by targeting the largest impact areas so that you make the most drastic impact reductions, or you may start by focusing on one particular area you find important. Regardless, dividing your environmental impact up into areas will allow you to better devise a strategy for going green.

<h3></h3>
<h3><b>3. Delegate tasks</b></h3>
You can’t take up the entire responsibility of going green by yourself. Delegate tasks among members of your team as well as contractors, and make sure to share your green goals with them. Contractors, in particular, likely will already have experience with sustainable practices and can provide valuable input for your events.

Remember, a team is most productive when everyone is on the same page, so finding a <a href=""//www.eventbank.com/platform/event-management/""><u>work platform</u></a> that eliminates miscommunication and encourages efficiency is just as crucial as dividing the work up.
<h3><b>4. Pick eco-friendly venues and cater responsibly</b></h3>
Venue selection and food sourcing are key to a green event. When selecting a venue, be sure to look for an accessible one that offers in-house equipment and support to reduce the carbon footprint that results from travel and transportation. You can even consider hosting the event virtually to not only be as green as possible but also reduce costs. As for food, reach out to attendees beforehand to accurately gauge the amount of food needed and partner with local food vendors to minimize your transportation footprint.

<h3><b>5. Reduce waste</b></h3>
Everyone knows that the crux of going green is reducing waste. Replace disposable silverware with reusable ones and purchased water bottles with water refill stations when possible. Beyond food waste, also be aware of the waste produced while creating event materials. Instead of paper invitations, admission tickets and badges, opt for online versions that can be easily designed and managed on digital platforms.

Our <a href=""//www.eventbank.com/platform/event-management/""><u>platform</u></a>, in particular, also has a mobile app that streamlines the event check-in process, keeps attendees informed before and during the event, and provides post-event analytics. Thus, not only will you eliminate paper waste, but you will also gather valuable information for your next event.

Our platform also has virtual membership cards making it more green for your organizaiton to deliver membership cards to your subscribers without needing to print them out. Book a demo to learn more!

2163,"7 Tips to Creating a Successful International Event","<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">“Globalization” is the buzzword of the day, and with good reason. </span><span class=""s1"">Regardless of where you are, be it a grocery store with imported products or an economic conference on international trade, it’s as if the world is all in one place. The effects of globalization have seeped into every corner of our lives, and the event industry is especially aware of this fact. Nowadays, no matter the type or the location of an event, there will almost always be attendees from a foreign country. For members of the industry, this trend means that the old ways of catering to mono-national attendees will no longer work. Then, a question arises: how can event organizers plan and manage a successful event with international attendees?</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""> As a multinational company committed to bringing people together and embracing all backgrounds, we at EventBank are passionate about this issue and would like to share some insights that we have accumulated over the years. We believe that making your international attendees feel at home is important not only because it is the event organizer’s job to do so, but also because it can help your business grow. Here are five steps to make sure that your event leaves a pleasant impression on everyone:</span></p>

<h2 class=""p1""><b>1. Be Culturally Sensitive</b></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""> First and foremost, make sure you have a basic understanding of the cultures that the attendees are coming from. You don’t want to do anything culturally inappropriate or, even worse, send the wrong message to your attendees and have them feel disrespected. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In particular, be on the lookout for dietary needs; you wouldn’t want to be serving a pig feast when your attendees can’t eat pork. Also, though your attendees may speak your language, do try to prepare event materials in their language—it is a nice gesture that can be easily done via <a href=""//www.eventbank.com/platform/overview/""><span class=""s2"">digital platforms</span></a>.</span></p>


[caption id=""attachment_2179"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]<img class=""wp-image-2179 size-large"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/international_6-1024x593.jpeg"" alt=""event management, event planning, globalization, international"" width=""1024"" height=""593"" /> Look out for your attendees' dietary restrictions! You wouldn't want to be serving a pig feast when your attendees can't eat pork.[/caption]
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>2. Personalize Your Invitations </b></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b> </b>Perhaps you are used to sending one mass email invitation to all your attendees. However, a simple email blast will not suffice in relationship-based cultures like India or Italy. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">For attendees from these places, your invitations have to make them feel special and wanted. That said, personalizing your invitations doesn’t have to be an arduous, time-consuming task. You can use <a href=""//get.eventbank.com/""><span class=""s2"">software</span></a> that allows you to easily manage your email lists and customize your invitations with graphics and other media.</span></p>

<h2 class=""p1""><b>3. Communicate Regularly with Your Attendees</b></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""> Communication shouldn’t stop after the invitation. Not only should you continue to send your attendees reminders about the event, but you should also keep them updated on any event changes or travel alerts. Imagine how an already-disoriented-from-traveling attendee would feel if he or she were to show up to an event session that had been canceled! </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Moreover, you can also prepare a travel checklist for your attendees, so that they can adjust as quickly as possible upon arrival and have the energy to fully enjoy your event later.</span></p>


[caption id=""attachment_2177"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]<img class=""wp-image-2177 size-large"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/international_4-1024x508.jpeg"" alt=""event management, international, globalization, event planning"" width=""1024"" height=""508"" /> Remember to send your attendees reminders about the event and keep them updated on any event changes or travel alerts.[/caption]
<h2 class=""p1""><b>4. Plan the Agenda Accordingly</b></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""> Different cultures view punctuality differently. For example, an American may aim to arrive five minutes early to an event, whereas a Brazilian may find it acceptable to arrive half an hour late to the same event. Plan your agenda accordingly with these cultural differences in mind. More specifically, leave enough downtime between sessions so that no one feels the need to rush to the next one. This way, you will maximize attendance for all your sessions and avoid the “empty seats” situation.</span></p>

<h2 class=""p1""><b>5. Consider Hosting a Virtual Event</b></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b> </b>Needless to say, hosting an international event requires a lot of manpower and coordination. If such an event feels impossible to organize at the moment, perhaps consider making it virtual. <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/event-spaces-going-digital/"">Virtual events</a> eliminate many of the hurdles that come with physical events, namely the lack of time and accessibility. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Moreover, not only are they easy on the budget, but they also contribute to the environmental cause of <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/event-management/how-to-plan-and-manage-a-sustainable-event/""><span class=""s2"">going green</span></a>. You may also get a greater turnout because you will also be saving your attendees a plane ticket! For inspiration, you can check out <a href=""//www.apacchamber.com/"">this virtual conference</a> for APAC chambers that we hosted earlier this year.</span></p>

<h2>6. Arrange for Transportation &amp; Housing</h2>
International Events are...international, so, that means you need to see from the perspective of attendees who are flying in or driving hard for your event. If they're engaged enough to attend your event from thousands of miles away, then you need to really provide them the best experience both in the event floor and outside the event. Most websites that host international events always have a section about transportation and hotels, even entertainment.

You can always show them maps, directions, and suggestions, but if you have the leverage, do try to arrange discounts with local hotels in your area and make it so that your attendees can actually save money before arriving. This all adds up to great experiences for those new to your area, and it really instills loyalty for them to return to future events if you so happen to be planning one.
<h2>7. Expand Your Ticketing Payment Processors</h2>
With international events comes the responsibility from your end to be able to accept payment methods not normally accustomed in your area. That means opening up your ticketing software to other payment processing companies and methods that you normally wouldn't support for a local event. You need to jump through hoops for your international attendees, and not the other way around.

A Chinese potential attendee may leave your site and your event behind entirely if you simply don't support the local Chinese methods like Union Pay or AliPay. You might even lose tech enthusiasts for hackathons if you don't harbor some form of cryptocurrency payments. Check out our <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/creative-hackathon-ideas/"">30 hackathon ideas</a> article to see what hackathons are all about.

2186,"Engagement Technology: Making Meaningful Connections","<em>An abridged version of this article was featured in the July-August edition of the EuroPH Connect Magazine.</em>

The world has its eyes on the Philippines. Since the turn of the century, the country’s impressive economic growth has garnered it much international attention. For example, in 2014, the World Economic Foundation declared it as the most improved country in terms of global competitiveness. Beyond this type of official praise, the Philippines has also received a huge influx of foreign companies that view it as a gateway to nearby Asian economies such as China and Malaysia. However, with the bountiful of business opportunities also comes a bountiful of challenges, the largest one of which is getting used to the local business etiquette.

It is universally acknowledged that connections and relationships are indispensable, like an engine is to a car, when it comes to finding success in the business world. This truth is especially true in the Philippines. Unlike in the West, a good business relationship on the archipelago is less corporate and more personal, less rushed and more relaxed. In fact, your Filipino business partner may even invite you to have dinner with his or her family before any formal discussion of business matters. With these more concrete ideas of Filipino business etiquette in mind, a question perhaps has arisen in your mind: how can one cultivate good relationships in the Philippines?

Before answering this question, it is helpful to think first about the relationships in our society at large. In today’s data-driven society, technology has transformed the way that relationships are formed and developed. With the advent of social media and other networking platforms, the pace and volume of communications have increased drastically, making it much easier than before to connect with someone. However, given all these connections, how do we make sure that they stay meaningful and not just become statistics on our profiles? More importantly, how do we leverage these connections, especially in relationship-centered cultures like the Philippines?

Here at EventBank, we are particularly aware of these changes and challenges. In fact, our mission is to use technology itself to “<em>transform the way professional communities around the world enable and enrich relationships</em>.” This transformation comes in the form of a cloud-based mobile platform that makes connections, say, between members in an association more personal and thus stronger. Our software does so by providing the members a digital space to collaborate, give and receive instant feedback, and always be on the same page. Moreover, we also offer personalized solutions in event management and customer relationship management. After all, greater engagement in any area equals greater profitability for businesses.

Such an engagement and management technology is the vehicle needed for a businessperson to successfully navigate the Philippine corporate world. It will allow him or her to begin new relationships and consolidate old ones. It will allow him or her to efficiently run a business and ensure its profitability. And finally, it will allow him or her to take full advantage of the economic paradise that is the Philippines.",,1970-01-01,post,http://blog.eventbank.com/?p=2186,,,,,,,,"Event Management|Uncategorized",,English,,draft,22,rocky,rocky.lam@eventbank.com,Rocky,Lam,,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-08-09
2199,"Best Practices in Membership Management - Panel discussion in Kuala Lumpur (Photos)","Communities exist because of the members that join them. A strong member community comes from ensuring engagement with the community is authentic and the events and interactions that these organizations deliver, not only foster a better community but help it grow.

To help associations and chambers of commerce in Malaysia better engage with their communities, EventBank hosted a panel discussion on August 14th, 2018 at American Chamber of Commerce Malaysia Executive office. The event brought together leaders of associations, chambers, non-profits and other member-based organizations to share the best practices and techniques to engage better with members, increase retention rates, improve the operations of the organizations and drive better results for stakeholders.

We would like to thank all the valuable speakers: Dr. Yeoh Oon Tean, CEO of the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers; Leo Salazar, CEO of BRIL Solutions and TSM Business School MBA Marketing Manager at the University of Twente; and Farida Aman, Head of Bumiputera Development at SME International Trade Association of Malaysia (SMiTA). We would also like to thank American Chamber of Commerce Malaysia for all their help and support with this event. It wouldn't be possible to host this event without them.

2320,"Data Misuse: What We Can All Learn From The Facebook Scandal","<h3 style=""text-align: left;"">A Lesson To Be Learned - A Reformed Look On Data Misuse</h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The words on everyone’s lips – data misuse. The reform of the Data Protection Act in Europe has become a watershed event in 2018 for a culmination of legal, ideological and political reasons. On the 25th of May, the renewed act witnessed strict changes to the provision of processing personal data, which would concern how data is retrieved, stored and destroyed. During this period data misuse has presented an unavoidable topic of discussion for software companies and social media platforms who handle personal data. At EventBank, changes in the law concerning data is important to us, so our online blog seeks to acknowledge how these changes came about and why they are important.</p>

<h4>The Facebook Scandal</h4>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Arguably, the Facebook scandal this year has been the catalyst to the refocusing of data misuse in our modern society. In 2015, Facebook failed to notify users their data was being retrieved and stored by an app designed by Cambridge Analytics. CA was a political firm who worked closely with the Donald Trump Campaign in the 2016 presidential election. This app named <i>thisisyourdigitalife</i> used Facebook as a bridge to gain access to the user's information. The database would collect information such as email addresses and likes from the user’s profile, then build a portfolio of personality traits. This was then collated to create marketing material specifically targeted at the user. It has been argued to have played a significant role in influencing the user and their political swing during the 2016 US presidential campaign. Consequently, the scandal led to a criminal investigation that resulted in the dissolution of the company on May the 1st.</p>
The backlash Facebook received from the scandal revealed a public consciousness that acknowledged the wrongdoing of data misuse. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/07/faceblock-campaign-urges-users-boycott-facebook-for-one-day-protest-cambridge-analytica-scandal"">The Guardian</a> investigated how an international group called 'The Faceblock campaign' urged users to boycott certain apps like Instagram and WhatsApp for 24 hours following the scandal. These pressure groups are important to consider because they reveal how this modern generation is both responsive and willing to educate the broader public on data misuse. Their presence and contribution may be considered critical in how they can influence broader trends, changing the way internet users use social media platforms. Indeed, these responses are what undermine and economically damage platforms like Facebook. Therefore, the scandal may be considered a defining example of the high risks and consequences involved when well-established companies fail to abide by data protection laws.

Now in the post-scandal period, it may be insightful to oversee how Facebook will rebuild its trust with the public and restore confidence for its users when using the platform. Having said this, Facebook is now well underway with changing their data protection policies and further information on this can be found at <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/business/gdpr"">Facebook Business.</a>
<h4 style=""text-align: left;"">New and Emerging Relationships?</h4>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The Facebook scandal should prompt important discussion for EventBank members to engage with, particularly for our branches in Asia. Indeed, Facebook is banned in Mainland China, though there have been significant developments this year. An article published by <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17607992/facebook-allowed-china-censorship-ban-hangzhou-zuckerberg"">The Verge</a> has investigated this, which states Facebook has obtained a license to open an office in China, located in the city of Hangzhou. The source adds, Facebook will make small investments and give advice to local businesses. For EventBank, these are critical developments, especially when we at EventBank use Facebook as a platform to promote our marketing materials. More broadly, this reveals a significant leap for China as they open a door to allow Western thinking to penetrate its market. Facebook could critically offer a financial incentive for Chinese investors, where perhaps the platform could open a gateway for both business and cultural exchanges.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">However, in light of recent events related to data misuse, it will be interesting to witness what happens next for Facebook's hold in China. Perhaps Facebook's stay in China could be short-lived, or significant changes may take place in order for the platform to remain. Again, it is necessary we at EventBank understand what these changes or developments may mean since we utilize the platform to promote our events and email campaigns.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">In the next coming months, it is certain there will be many watchful eyes on this potentially new and emerging relationship.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: left;"">EventBank's Code and Conduct</h4>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The effects of the Facebook scandal will stretch beyond the Western hemisphere and will present a sharp learning curve for all internet users. As an international company, EventBank does come into contact with personal data, so changes in the law is critical to our acknowledgment. At EventBank we value our enriched relationships and networks with the broader world, where at the heart of this success is honest communication (<a href=""https://www.eventbank.com/company/about/#values"">explore EventBank values</a>). We do this by promoting respect, kindness and utmost integrity when openly expressing ourselves. Thus, data misuse has not, and will not, ever hold a place on our platform.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">EventBank understands data misuse as a violation to both our clients and employee’s privacy, so we, therefore, work hard to protect and maintain it. We ensure this information is clearly accessible, communicated and understood through our approach of transparency. For those who need to question, comment or retrieve information about our security measures, we make readily available.<img class=""wp-image-2349 size-thumbnail aligncenter"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/value2@2x-150x150.png"" alt="""" width=""150"" height=""150"" /><img class=""wp-image-2351 aligncenter"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/value6@2x-150x150.png"" alt="""" width=""172"" height=""172"" /></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Below are some measures EventBank enforces related to data protection (<a href=""https://www.eventbank.com/platform/security/"">learn more about EventBank Security)</a></p>

<ul style=""text-align: left;"">
 	<li>In terms of payments being made, no credit card information is stored on our databases. This immediately eliminates the risk of information being retrieved or manipulated in any capacity.</li>
 	<li>Our platforms are DDoS supported, along with firewalls to prevent our system from encountering harmful malware.</li>
 	<li>Vulnerability assessments are also conducted on a consistent basis to check for potential cyber-attacks. Meaning, we don’t just rely on programs to do the work for us, we too actively pursue anything that threatens the code and conduct of our work.</li>
</ul>
<h4 style=""text-align: left;"">A Fine Line</h4>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The Facebook scandal has crystallized important moral and ethical distinctions in relation to data misuse. After Facebook faced the iron fist of the US Congress, it can be said the consequences of data misuse are clear. Essentially, data misuse can damage the reputation of your business, destroying your credibility as a professional platform. In doing so, this reveals a serious neglect of modern digital thinking, a failure to educate a conceptualization of the basic ethical standards that should support your software platforms. Consequently, this can undermine and isolate your business on the market, as well as your employees and clients.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Comparably, when a company promotes and enforces data protection measures, their decision will carry authority and conviction. Law-abiding companies will present themselves as conscientious and forward thinking, attributes that illustrate a professionally driven and integrative business. With this being said, understanding these differences could critically draw the line between a companies success or ultimate downfall.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: left;"">A Right To Privacy and It's Misconceptions</h4>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Data protection is important and affects us all, regardless if you do or do not engage with social media platforms like Facebook. Unfortunately, issues with protecting our privacy can extend to all areas of our life, and sometimes we make poor and ill-informed decisions to guard it. In our modern society, these poor decisions are greatly influenced by popular misconceptions. A common misconception is the idea that you can find a computer application that reliably secures all of your devices for the charge of absolutely nothing. Here at EventBank, we have sadly responded to many clients who have downloaded these misleading platforms. In practice, they are poorly constructed systems, which do not retain powerful enough features to help protect against harmful malware. At EventBank, we encourage our clients and employees to conduct a thorough research for credible applications that guarantee maximum security and protection. Equally, we hope the Facebook scandal will prompt more of us to think carefully about the applications we choose to use and how far they will go to protect our right to privacy (<a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/eventbank-story/eventbank-csr-supporting-non-profit-organizations-software/"">find out how EventBank thinks about CSR</a>).</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: left;"">Data Misuse Matters</h4>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">But why should we care? We live in the age of technology, an era that is continuously engaging with fast pace and innovative technological advancements. As a result, technology forms part of our everyday life and is the lifeline to a majority of our daily operations. Thus, the more we build technology into our lives, the more control we need over it. Meaning, if we continue to engage and share our personal information online, then we must make it our responsibility to understand what this means for our right to privacy.  If we fail to educate ourselves about these developments and changes in data use, then our passivity may leave us vulnerable in this ever-growing technological world.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">As we progress forward from the Facebook scandal, we hope there is a lesson to be learned about data misuse. A lesson learned not just for Facebook, but a universal lesson for us all to engage with and pay attention to. Ultimately, together we can we can work harder to educate each other and strive to better our tech world.</p>

2439,"EventBank Officially Launches Russian Joint Venture","<em>Moscow &amp;  Hong Kong - October 9, 2018</em> EventBank, a leading cloud-based engagement management software company, has officially announced its expansion to the Russian market via a joint venture with Andrey K. Zhukovskiy, founder of RussСom IT Systems. The collaboration combines the market-leading strengths of EventBank’s all-in-one software management solutions with Mr. Zhukovskiy's experience in the event and association market to bring EventBank's solutions to Russian corporations, event organizers, associations and other organizations. Formation of this partnership (<u><a href=""https://www.eventbank.ru/"">www.eventbank.ru</a></u>) is a significant milestone in EventBank’s global ambitions following the <a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/eventbank-story/expansion-for-asias-largest-event-membership-management-software-company-eventbank/"">recent opening of new offices in Singapore and Hong Kong</a>.

Founded in 2013 by CEO Eric L. Schmidt and COO Olivia Jingshu Ji, EventBank has since become a leading event and membership management technology company in the Asia Pacific and the United States. EventBank has offices in the US, Hong Kong, Singapore, China and India, and its <a href=""https://www.eventbank.com/solutions/event-marketing-management-cloud/"">award-winning Event Management Software</a>, Association Management Software, and Chamber of Commerce Management Software are used by customers in more than 28 countries.

CEO and co-Founder Eric L. Schmidt said, “This partnership is an important cornerstone for EventBank’s growth. We are proud to be joining forces with successful technology veterans in the MICE space in Russia and are excited to introduce our cutting-edge software to the market. We have been working hard over the last few months to localize our platform to cater to the specific needs of the Russian market, and are eager to enable the professional communities from St. Petersburg to Vladivostok with EventBank solutions.”

Mr. Andrey K. Zhukovskiy is a highly successful entrepreneur who has a stronghold within the tech and meetings industry. In 2001, Zhukovskiy founded RussСom IT Systems Group of Companies, a company providing a number of exclusive services designed for event organizers, such as accreditation, business program, and B2B meetings, exhibition personnel and IT solutions for the MICE industry. Zhukovskiy is also Chairman of the Marketing and Research Committee of Russian Union of Exhibitions and Fairs, member of the Committee on exhibition, fair and сongress activities at the Сhamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation, member of the Exhibitions Committee at the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, member of the Marketing Committee of the Global Association of Exhibitions UFI, and member of the interdepartmental working group on exhibitions of The Russian Export Center.

Schmidt and founder of RussСom IT Systems Andrey K. Zhukovskiy, have now signed the EventBank Russia Joint Venture agreement, making the partnership official. EventBank's cloud-based solutions are now available to Russian corporations, event organizers, associations and other organizations.[/caption]

&nbsp;

Mr. Zhukovskiy says, “Having re-analyzed the Russian market of IT solutions for MICE industry and associations’ management, two important conclusions have been drawn. The first being, we have a rapidly growing market with a huge potential and many companies working on the MICE technology. The second, none of these many companies offer all-in-one integrated solutions like EventBank that would work in real time and satisfy all clients' requirements. After close consideration, we have decided to partner with EventBank to bring the best event and association management solutions to Russia that is hungry for the technology that can meet all the needs.”

This partnership presents a plethora of opportunities when the Russian event industry is incredibly vast and varied, where to date there are currently over 100 cities with the infrastructure to cater for events. Russian's share on global MICE industry is currently estimated at less than 1%, and with around 13,000 congress events organized each year, International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA) places Russia at 22nd place in a number of events organized. Both Moscow and St. Petersburg are among the top 100 of the most popular congress destinations in the world. Coupled with this, there are more than a 1,000 event organizers, associations, and unions. These figures prompt an important reconsideration that showcases Russian locations as up and coming in the events market. Positive prospects significantly complement EventBank's ambitions to become the leader in event and association management software space in Russia.

General Manager of EventBank Russia, Mrs. Maria Makarova, commented, “When observing the rapid growth in the Russian event market, setting ourselves apart from the competition as a provider of innovative all-in-one solutions is critical when attracting our targeted audiences. EventBank provides the necessary resources to automate day-to-day processes, particularly tasks that are commonly time-consuming for event organizers and associations alike. I am sure in a few years EventBank will be the leading choice for management software solutions in the Russian market.”

EventBank Russia has already opened some basic operations a couple months ago in Moscow to ensure that the product was optimized to fit all the requirements specific to the Russian market. Localizations include integration with the local payment gateway, data compliance under Russian law, set up of <a href=""https://www.eventbank.ru/"">EventBank.ru</a> domain and translation of the platform and mobile apps into the Russian language.

COO and co-founder Olivia Jingshu Ji expressed, “With our client base spreading across almost 30 different countries, we are ecstatic to extend EventBank's technology to Russia via this joint venture with a local expert in the field! At EventBank, we are honored to establish this new relationship and look forward to the on-going cooperation. I would like to thank and extend my appreciation for the tireless efforts put in by both teams - this joint venture would not have been successful without them. This is certainly a great moment in EventBank's history.”",,2018-10-09,post,http://blog.eventbank.com/eventbank-officially-launches-russian-joint-venture/,http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/alexander-smagin-627461-unsplash.jpg|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Eric-Schmidt-and-Andrey-K.-Zhukovskiy-signing-EventBank-Russia-joint-venture-in-Shanghai-China.png|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/serge-kutuzov-496941-unsplash.jpg,"alexander-smagin-627461-unsplash|Eric Schmidt and Andrey K.

이벤트뱅크의 프로그램은 국내 행사기획자, 컨벤션뷰로, 협.단체들에게 업무의 생산성과 효율성을 극대화 시킴을  목표로 행사 홈페이지 제작, 신속하며 간편한 현장등록 및 입장권 결제, 현장 출석체크까지 가능한 행사 관리 프로그램과 학회, 협회, 연합회등의 개별적 회원관리를 위한 회원 관리 프로그램을 중심으로 국내 시장에서 입지를 넓혀갈 계획이다.

아시아 대륙 및 미국 등지에서 눈에 띄는 속도로 성장하고 있는 이벤트 뱅크는 최근 러시아에서의 합작투자사 설립, 싱가포르 및 홍콩 신규 지사 설립에 이어 TSM과의 파트너십 체결로 OECD가입국중 가장 인터넷이 발달되어 있으며 세계에서 기술적인 부분과 디지털에 있어서 가장 앞서 있는 대한민국에서 시장의 리더가 될것이다.

이벤트뱅크의 대표이사 Eric Schmidt는 “두 회사의 전문성을 통하여, 한국시장 내 이벤트뱅크의 자동화 프로그램이 빠른 성장을 이룰 것입니다. 우리의 기술력을 통하여 한국 내의 여러 전문기관이 더욱 업무의 효율화가 이뤄질 것으로 기대합니다. “라고 말했다.

TSM 서원준 대표이사는 “한국시장에 고객정보관리(CRM)를 포함한 종합적인 일체형 이벤트 관리 프로그램의 필요성을 항상 느껴왔다.”고 말했다. “TSM과 이벤트뱅크의 이번 협력은 한국시장에 있어서 많은 기회를 만들 것이라고 생각합니다. 한국은 아시아에서 수많은 행사가 개최되는 나라 중 하나이기 때문에, 두회사의 상호협력은 이벤트뱅크가 한국 시장에 성공적으로 진출하게 할 것이고, 앞으로 수십년동안  CRM을 포함한 이벤트 관리 프로그램의 확산을 위한 최선의 선택이 될 것이라고 굳게 믿고 있습니다.”

2673,"CMO Breakfast: Making Brands Matter in the Digital Transformation Era with Sheilen Rathod","A decade into the Digital Transformation movement, many businesses are still grappling with it.

2768,"Event Management Software for Business: Your 8 Best Options","Hosting and running events has gotten easier due to the advent of event management software. If you haven't looked into this yet, then you know running events is possibly one of the biggest headaches for any business today. Want to run an event on your own? You'll need to drum up some marketing materials both physically and digitally. You'll need infrastructure to ticket and sign in attendees. You'll probably want to use an email campaign to promote and remind guests. And you'll need a link to send them to with all the things they need to sign up online.

Costly, right?

Not any more. A range of tools has been released in due course to the headaches experienced by those who are fed up with the pain of running an event without proper tools in place. Whether it be hosting one-off events or multiple events, you'll now be able to shop to your heart's content for a provider that works for your event needs.

We've got a list of the 8 best event management software tools out there (in no particular order) to make your shopping just a little bit easier.

Is this list not what you're looking for? Here's our list of <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/best-membership-management-software/"">membership management software</a>, and our list of <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/best-chamber-management-software/"">chamber management software</a>.

<h2>What if I just use my current tools instead of Event Management Software?</h2>
Sure you could use pre-existing tools to do such a thing, like leveraging Mailchimp or making your own landing pages, but with most SaaS models these days, it's just going to add more load to your package, and you'll be up a certain kind of creek without a paddle should you hit your package limits for even just one of your tools. You'll still need a ticketing partner nonetheless.

Event Management software specialize in that they create tools that are specifically designed to work together <b>synchronously. </b>With some tools even giving you a domain to call home for your event so you don't have to go out and buy your own or carve out real-estate on your website for the event.
<h2 id=""eventbank""><a href=""//www.eventbank.com"">EventBank</a></h2>

Of course, we'd put <a href=""//get.eventbank.com"">EventBank</a> in this list, we've striven to take our headaches in event management and transformed it into the fuel that motivates us to create one of the only<i> full-stack </i>event management software suites out there. That means top-to-bottom event management for your business that takes all the guesswork out of the equation because <b>we've been there</b>.

Enjoy a full CRM that captures everyone who connects with you and signs up to attend, or even upload lists of people you'd like to invite. Event Bank also sports a full email creation tool that allows you to design and send email campaigns with a wide range of options. And like any good event organizer, you probably want the event to have its own webpage or even website.

Instead of going to set it up yourself, EventBank's Event Management Software will allow you to generate a professional event page for your event using your content with minimal effort for a sleek appearance, all piggybacking on our network so you get the best domain authority on Google search results from the get-go. You will also be able to manage your finances and ticketing of the event from the platform as well, using a multitude of payment and pricing options that are completely up to you.

<b>Pros:</b> Completely integrated tools built to work together in a secure platform that handles the whole event life cycle. Actionable membership insights.

<b>Cons:</b> Not exactly plug-and-play. The platform's value comes from its integration into an organization, so there's a fair bit of on-boarding process involved.

<h2 id=""eventbrite""><a href=""//www.eventbrite.com"">Eventbrite</a></h2>
<img class=""size-medium wp-image-2776 aligncenter"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/eventbrite-174x300.png"" alt=""event management software for business"" />
Eventbrite is the most well-known event-management tool on the market. A fast and simplified event hosting platform, it allows events of any size host itself there, and ticket through its own ticketing partners. Eventbrite is incredibly versatile in that there are virtually no barriers to making your own event and publishing it on their platform. If brand visibility isn't a problem for you, then you can easily set up your own events page with a straightforward ticketing function with ease, albeit with their logo stuck all over.

The entire platform is not meant to be a stable place to call home. While your EventBrite account saves relevant data from past events, it's not like you can just create event-after-event. You have little options when it comes to sequential event set up so EventBrite is best for one-off events that need to get in front of eyes quickly. EventBrite heavily lacks in promotional features at the free level, so it's kind of like a directory with the option to ticket through it.

<strong>Pros:</strong> Free to use, easy to set up.

<strong>Cons:</strong> Not much customization or branding options. Not the best for on-going and sequential events long term.
<h2 id=""bizzabo""><a href=""//www.bizzabo.com"">Bizzabo</a></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2773 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bizzabo.png"" alt=""Free Event Management Software"" width=""844"" height=""541"" />

Bizzabo is another tool that combines the tools required for a full-stack event management suite that allows users to build websites, manage contacts, promote the event, and more. The entire platform additionally supports attendee networking by providing a separate app that's meant to help attendees at events exchange contact information and register their ticket at the door. Bizzabo also has a strong line up of early integrations to the platform but sadly lock some of the more prevalent integrations behind it's most expensive package.

<strong>Pros:</strong> Bizzabo utilizes networking to boost analytics at the platform level.

<strong>Cons:</strong> Some important integrations are locked behind package pricing at the highest level.
<h2 id=""aventri""><a href=""//www.aventri.com/"">Aventri</a></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2772 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Aventri.png"" alt=""Event Management Tools"" width=""856"" height=""497"" />

Much like EventBank and Bizzabo, Aventri is following the recent trend of providing event management software in an all-in-one package. This time with Aventri focusing more on the event-floor value aspect of the event management equation. While it includes all the necessary items to be considered an event management software like CRM, Website building, and more, Aventri includes easy offline-to-online translation of business card. That means no more manually adding business cards to the platform post-event. Just take a photo and you're good to go. A godsend for your event frontline people.

Event Management Software is one of those things, however, that requires a bit of set-up and customer support. Especially the all-in-one model. Aventi elects to push integration and most importantly, customer support, to higher pricing levels. Effectively leaving out the smaller scale businesses who likely need the on-boarding help.

<strong>Pros:</strong> Frontline business card reading makes life easier for post-event contact capture.

<strong>Cons:</strong> While scalable, the features that give the most valuable benefit enterprise customers the most, while smaller scale cannot really access great features like customer success or integrations.
<h2 id=""eventdex""><a href=""//eventdex.com"">EventDex</a></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2774 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Event-Dex.png"" alt=""Event Management Solutions"" width=""596"" height=""396"" />

EventDex is an interesting choice on this list as it seems to take a mobile-only approach to event management software solutions. EventDex can best be described as 4 separate products that are entirely focused on the mobile aspect of event management software and registration/ticketing interface. The products are split into different feature-sets: Onsite Management, Event Registration, Business Matchmaking, and Lead Retrieval.

Onsite Management facilitates all on-site needs, meaning registration at the door, event seating, maps, and analytics. While business Matchmaking entices all registrants to submit their information in hopes they will download the EventDex app and scan each other's information and start networking. Event Registration takes registration and ticketing to mobile, and Lead Retrieval facilitates on-site post-event business card scanning to bring offline contact info the contact management database that all of EventDex's products share.

All packages have their own app, so the entire SaaS model is not all-in-one. A great way to fill in a gap if you're missing something, but not the best choice for a full-stack event management software solution.

<strong>Pros:</strong> Mobile only feature sets that can enhance on-site event management and networking.

<strong>Cons:</strong> Lacks a cohesive platform that allows for one app to run all features.
<h2 id=""idloom""><a href=""//idloom.com"">Idloom</a></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2781 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Real-Idloom.png"" alt=""Event Management Platforms"" width=""636"" height=""464"" />

Idloom, or also called Idloom-Events, is an all-in-one event management software suite that lacks a certain amount of customization, but makes up for it with scalability. It's got it all there, CRM, event website builder, and more, but lacks any sort of event promotion feature-set like email campaigns.

While it's got the moves, it what it does with them that makes it stand out. It's gone freemium at it's most basic package, keeping the essentials for you to run free events. The travesty of this package, however, is one important but unassuming feature that is surprisingly unavailable for free users: <u>contact list uploading</u>.

Contact list uploading is a must-have for any event management software (or any CRM for that matter), and why it's not available for even free users is something that bothers any reasonable event manager. It costs very little to enhance an important part of the user experience. I dare say that a good contact uploading experience for me is a major selling point for me when it comes to evaluating new products.

<strong>Pros:</strong> Freemium to start

<strong>Cons:</strong> Freemium lacks any real applicability and basic functions you would expect like in EventBrite.
<h2 id=""ivvy"">Ivvy</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2778 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Idloom.png"" alt=""Event Management for Companies"" width=""1068"" height=""456"" />

Ivvy is an event-management and booking suite that has its current roots in AU, NZ, UK, and US. While it is indeed another all-in-one packaged event management software tool, it focuses on supporting local events rather than targeting the global market. To do this, it's created local networks of venues with preferred pricing and offers them up in a slick marketplace-like get up. There's not much to say here other than there's a lot of local support provided from the beginning. So if you're looking to start an event in these areas, early-on setup should be a breeze even before the event starts selling tickets.

<strong>Pros:</strong> local venue marketplace

<strong>Cons:</strong> No Email marketing, analytics or ticketing features until you pay their 3rd highest package or above.
<h2 id=""eventsframe""><a href=""//eventsframe.com"">Events Frame</a></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2777 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Events-Frame.png"" alt=""Event Management problems"" width=""923"" height=""524"" />

EventsFrame is a neat event hosting platform for budget events. At low-low prices, you can host an event on a webpage, ticket, and manage contacts. No email marketing to mention, but it makes up for it with a very, very detailed focus on analytics and SEO. The main value here is to help you drive traffic to your event page. So if you don't have a list to start off with, this is probably a good go-to place to convert organic traffic. The lack of any email promotion tool likely emphasizes this tool's focus on search-driven organic traffic.

<strong>Pros:</strong> Cheap event page hosting. Free 30-day trial.

<strong>Cons:</strong> Lacks any sort of promotion tools.
<h2>Back to you.</h2>
There's a bunch more tools out there of course, but with a majority of them focusing on core features rather than “event management” as a whole, it's not very helpful to hold them up to a candle like EventBrite, EventBank, Aventri and all the other top dogs in the industry.

There's pros and cons pockmarked across any app out there, but we hope for event management needs, we've drilled down exactly what you might be looking for. We'll do our best to keep this list up-to-date and ready for your window-shopping eyes.

2908,"16 Great Membership Management Software Options","Managing your members isn't like managing your leads or customers. These are people who trust in your organization to provide them your value in the most personable way possible. Regardless of your size, a member feels like they <i>belong</i> to your organization, rather than just patronizing it. And face it, you've gone digital or you're about to go digital, so you'll need membership management software that works.
<blockquote>Update: This article has been updated to include the subsidiary tools of some of these providers including acquisitions, and joint ventures like WebLink.</blockquote>
<h2>Who needs Membership Management Software? I have a CRM!</h2>
CRMs do the job. No doubt. But in reality, what you need is something a little more tangible for your members. Not customer relationship, but member relationship, we'd like to coin it MRM, <strong>Member Relationship Management</strong>.

A run of the mill CRM's personability comes from its ability to leverage contact info and provide merge tags to customize variables in emails or other communique. The reality is that this is helpful for pushing sales and keeping a sales team in line. Membership management software can do this of course too, but once a member joins, the job becomes a question of how do you engage and delight these members so they not only continue their membership but would outwardly invite others to join your organization?

Well, there's a plethora of membership management software out there that tackle this, and we're going to show you exactly what their individual values are and how they stack up for your specific membership management needs.

EventBank started off as an event management software that transformed immensely since it's inception as a platform. With customer feedback and pain points, the platform's versatility eventually caught the attention of companies and organizations who host events to increase engagement at scale. With this in mind, feature additions and improvements have added membership management to its retinue of use cases.

Fully customized to an organization's needs, the platform is entirely made up of parts of a whole. the CRM aspect is there, but as we said before, the real needs happen after members convert. EventBank makes sure you have the web presence for your events ready and leverages contact info to personalize email campaigns, ticketing, and finances all from the platform, which also has mobile versions available for in-person check-ins, melding in-person relationships with the digital back end.

<b>Pros:</b> All-in-one solution for both membership management and engagement needs.

<b>Cons: </b>Lack of CRM integrations for clients who currently use a third party. (integrations will come in 2020)
<h2 id=""wildapricot""><a href=""//wildapricot.com"">WildApricot</a></h2>

WildApricot is the most direct approach to the solution of membership management for small organizations and there's not much flair to go along with it. It is also one of the more original solutions that first cropped up a few years ago as the need for membership management software became more and more apparent. So it's definitely a go-to source for your most basic, small scale membership management needs, but not much else like the sacrifice of scalability for organizations that intend to grow.

<b>Pros: </b>Cheap and gets the job done.

<b>Cons:</b> Not very scalable for growing organizations or those that have multiple locations or chapters.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2912 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sumac.jpg"" alt=""Membership Management Software suite"" width=""800"" height=""547"" />

Sumac is a feature-rich event and membership management software suite much like EventBank, but without the all-in-one aspect. It considers its own native features as add-ons and requires customers to pay for each addon they want. So don't approach this product if you don't have a clear plan in mind, or else you may end up paying or add-ons you don't need. Thankfully event free-level users can talk to a sales rep who might be able to help you out.

The entire ecosystem Sumac has created is based on it's “Basic CRM” which is the core of the whole package. The addons simply feed the CRM or feed themselves from the CRM, to help with event management, ticketing, reminders, etc. A solid idea for users who intend on very specific membership management needs and don't expect to scale much. Which packages have their own benefits, none lock off features? Packages merely express the level of support you'll receive as a customer. No matter the package you choose, your addon costs may vary.

<b>Pros:</b> Bespoke feature-pricing model that can fit niche membership management needs.

<b>Cons</b>: Not a scalable model for organizations with varying needs over time.
<h2 id=""joinit""><a href=""//joinit.org"">Join It</a></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2913 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Join-It.png"" alt=""members management"" width=""1480"" height=""1040"" />

Join It is a landing-page based membership management software tool that leverages the digital savviness of your members to use the platform on the front end to engage with the organization. There's a CRM, of course, to capture and record your communication and a Stripe-integrated ticketing scheme.

The pricing model seems scalable at first but only at the highest level. At the free and cheapest level, the platform only benefits organizations with less than 1000 contacts. That's not exactly the best approach in this situation as you'd have plentiful “Contacts”, but converting members. Meaning that for promotional reasons, you'd likely run into issues when it comes to campaigns. Likely you'll have to turn to a third party EDM tool to keep your Join It platform account below the 1000 contact limits. Not a huge issue if you're large enough to go for the more premium package.

<b>Pros: </b>One of the few membership management tools that have web-hosted member engagement.
<b>
Cons: </b>Not exactly versatile at lower pricing levels.<b> </b>
<h2 id=""memberclicks""><a href=""//memberclicks.com"">MemberClicks</a></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2917 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MemberClicks.png"" alt=""membership"" width=""1054"" height=""578"" />

MemberClicks takes the EventBank route in offering an all-in-one membership management software suite of tools and integrations. However this time the pricing model is similar to Join It's except it's tackled the issue of contacts polluting the actual membership list. It does so by showing you exactly what your limits are for each level in the package list. Among that, it boasts a great member-to-member communication hub for members to discuss topics with themselves, thereby driving engagement without much set-up required.
<h3>WebLink</h3>
A smaller subsidiary of MemberClicks is WebLink, which is a similar solution to MemberClick's platform. <a href=""//www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/memberclicks-acquires-weblink-an-association-management-software-company-300548367.html"">Acquired by MemberClicks</a> in 2017, WebLink has been taken into the MemberClicks's fold in hopes of expanding its product offerings to <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/best-chamber-management-software/"">chambers</a> and associations which has been the primary focus of WebLink since its launch.

<b>Pros: </b>Great in-platform community section that allows members to talk to each other. Automatic engagement without lifting a finger.

<b>Cons: </b>The pricing packages seem to be relevant to large associations and organizations for professionals, and lack any sort of leeway for small organizations to scale up. However, with the acquisition of WebLink smaller organizations may benefit from this offering, even if they're not a Chamber, as both WebLink and MemberClicks have been combining and sharing features since the acquisition.
<h2 id=""membernova""><a href=""//membernova.com"">MemberNova</a></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2910 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Member-Nova.png"" alt=""membership management tools"" width=""621"" height=""363"" />

There's not much to say here about MemberNova except that it's another all-in-one membership management software platform just like MemberClicks and EventBank. The most notable difference is that it leverages member's social media and integrates to their accounts for a seamless sign-up process and the ability to quickly generate long lists of directories for associations.

The only real downside is that MemberNova lacks any sort of registration process from their mobile app. Where most membership management software tools are including in-person mobile registry, MemberNova only really provides backend platform management for clients.

<b>Pros: </b>Great for backend association management needs
<b>
Cons:</b> Poor offline-to-online registry and web event hosting tools.
<h2 id=""memberleap""><a href=""//memberleap.com"">MemberLeap</a></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2914 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MemberLeap.jpg"" alt=""Membership Tools"" width=""1280"" height=""720"" />

MemberLeap is once again another all-in-one membership management software suite but this time with a bit more of hard-line approach to pricing. It's got all the main features as the others without much notable difference other than that they boast their own learning center and certifications so clients have an at-the-ready resource to benefit their usage of the platform.

Despite this learning center, set-up costs are a major factor in their pricing scheme, where certain features are out of reach like payment processing for more expensive packages. This leaves one to wonder what the point of a learning center is if it only benefits a fraction of customers.

<b>Pros: </b>Self-help leaves users more educated<b> </b>
<b>
Cons:</b> Self-help and learning center seems only beneficial for users at more premium packages. As well seems that set up is not intrinsic as it's apparently a large part of the selling process.
<h2 id=""neoncrm""><a href=""//neoncrm.com"">Neon CRM</a></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2915 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NEON-CRM.png"" alt=""Membership CRM"" width=""960"" height=""720"" />

Neon CRM is a hard-core CRM platform that focuses on front-end engagement for a more niche part of memberships, volunteers. NeonCRM has email automation and event management tools that stack up, but most importantly is the CRM's ability to help associations and organizations with sizable volunteer headcounts. Volunteers are not paying members, and they're not leads. They're an important part of non-profits, and so that's where NeonCRM sets out to help, with non-profits and NGOs.

While there lacks any reminder automation for renewals and membership dues for obvious reasons, it approaches volunteers with tasks, surveys and content delivery that would ideally help harmonize sizable volunteer oriented organizations. With this in mind, the pricing scheme is quite affordable for organizations who aren't seeking to make a profit, while those who do, will face additional fees based on data and contacts, a fairly typical schema. The real cost for NGO's come from NeonCRM's on-boarding and consulting one-time fees that aim to help get users up to speed on the back end of the platform, as most nonprofits have high turnover rates.

<b>Pros: </b>Not scalable for member-engagement.
<b>
Cons:</b> Extremely scalable for NGO's and non-profits who seek to manage volunteers rather than leads.
<h2 id=""admidio""><a href=""//www.admidio.org/"">Admidio</a></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5421 size-large"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/admidio-1024x614.png"" alt=""admidio membership "" width=""680"" height=""408"" />

Admidio is an open-source and old-school style of membership management software that can trace its roots back to pure contact management since it's inception. It's added on features over the years and has made great strides in its development since then.

Looks can be deceiving, so while the platform is not in the cloud, and must be a downloaded program for servers. So the networked version web app of Admidio can only truly be accessed by webmasters once it's integrated into your website's server, and not just the integrated into the site as third-party content management. With this in mind, the barrier to adoption can be quite daunting. The program, however, is free of charge, so it depends on which benefits can outweigh the migration work ahead of you.

Plugins are what really bring Admidio to life, and it's suggested that you analyze what plugins you require before migrating Admidio into your servers. Plugins help add forms, logins, calendars, statistics, forums, and more to be added to the program and your site. There's even some date-triggered automation involved. Due to the open-source nature of Admidio, updates are frequent, but can oftentimes be unstable, unverified, or even sometimes poorly translated into English if the developer is not a native speaker.

<strong>Pros</strong>: Free, constantly updated, open-source (so it's basically modifiable), and has an active community of plugin developers.

<strong>Cons</strong>: On-campus and must be installed into your web-servers before it can be operational. Plugins can be unverified or deprecated frequently.
<h2 id=""memberplanet""><a href=""//www.memberplanet.com/#/"">MemberPlanet</a></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5420 size-large"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/memberplanet-779x1024.jpg"" alt=""member planet"" width=""680"" height=""894"" />

MemberPlanet is an all-in-one type of membership management software in the vein of EventBank and Wild Apricot, but it excels are its ability to jumpstart new organizations that are willing to put the money up first. Memberplanet offers branding and design services on top of its platform to create organizations from thin air, digitally speaking.

However, if you're already an established organization, then this may need to require some window shopping on your end. Unlike it's more direct competition from a pricing model standpoint, Wild Apricot does not offer any support for users with the exception of enterprise-level clients. This means Member planet users can enjoy full customer support and onboarding from Day 1, even free and trial users. The largest drawback to this is that its free package is a little too restricting for anyone's taste, with only 100 email credits per month and a lack of smart list accessibility.

<strong>Pros</strong>: Starts free, including standard support and onboarding.

<strong>Cons</strong>: Lack of integrations, through API access is available so this may require a conversation with Memberplanet. Highly constricting free packages.
<h2 id=""member365""><a href=""https://member365.com/"">Member 365</a></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16293 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Member365.jpg"" alt=""member 365"" width=""850"" height=""514"" />

Member 365 is a full-packaged membership management suite. It's got your core features like CRM, Email Marketing, Ticketing, and Events, but it's even got the latest cravings like surveys, online stores, community directories, and other great features that really round out the entire platform. It's got a sleek design and a thorough knowledge base for its components.

The issue? It's <em>pricey</em>. Starting at <strong>150 USD per month, </strong>it is by far one of the highest-priced software products on this list. With the suite of features though, one would assume the money could be worth it, if it wasn't for its horridly low allowances for contacts, starting at 500 contacts with only 2500 email credits per month. While smaller organizations could use these allowances month-to-month, it's hard to swallow the price at lower membership counts save some more luxury organizations that ask for higher member dues. Member 365 has a look of a sleek, scalably priced startup, but it certainly has an aim for more deeper-pocketed organizations rather than the little guys.

<strong>Pros</strong>: Extremely feature-rich platform and sleek UI.

<strong>Cons</strong>: Pricey packages that offer very constricting allowances.
<h2 id=""memberleap""><a href=""https://www.memberleap.com/"">MemberLeap</a></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16292 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/member-leap.jpg"" alt=""member leap"" width=""703"" height=""470"" />

MemberLeap is a very integration-heavy membership management platform that offers core features that you would expect in any membership management software package. It's got a solid customer and tech support infrastructure and it seems they're willing to work with you from day-in and day-out to make the most of your digital presence.

The curious situation here is that the pricing strays from certain norms. The early packages, ignoring the website integration fees, is reasonably priced at 50 USD per month and includes member database, email, and newsletters features, but that's about where it ends. There's no info that we could find about allowances, so we'll have to take this with a grain of salt.

The main pain point here is their attack on events. As any reasonable event features are priced at the 200USD per month mark for basic events features. We assume this high price tag is due to the level of integration offered though, so it could be reasonable depending on how deep the integration goes.

Oh, and they charge for GDPR compliance.<em> WHAT?</em>

<strong>Pros</strong>: Starts reasonably priced for the level of engagement you can get out of the basic features (allowances depending of course)

<strong>Cons</strong>: The higher the packages go in value, the less value gets provided. Also, <strong>they charge you</strong><em> for their own GDPR compliance</em>. It's not against the rules, but it's certainly against the norm for companies to charge customers for their privacy which is now protected by law.
<h2 id=""starchapter""><a href=""https://www.starchapter.com/"">StarChapter</a></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16294 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/star-chapter.jpg"" alt=""STAR CHAPTER"" width=""659"" height=""399"" />

StarChapter is a membership management software that focuses on chapter-based organizations, chambers, and associations specifically. This, in turn, gives them more direct features that make a positive impact on organizations like CRM, Events management, website management, and emails.

Pricing is reasonable, and the features are not paywalled. You simply need to upgrade packages based on the number of members, starting with anywhere below 50 members at 44 USD per month, and reasonably scaling up with the membership count. The only caveat is that they charge a setup fee, which may make it harder to decide to jump into this software product.

<strong>Pros</strong>: Pricing packages that make sense and don't paywall features that are critical to organizational success.

<strong>Cons</strong>: A one-time setup fee that can be a bit hefty for newcomers and small organizations.
<h2 id=""hivebrite""><a href=""https://hivebrite.com/"">Hivebrite</a></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16290 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Hivebrite.jpg"" alt=""Hivebrite"" width=""686"" height=""560"" />

Hivebrite is an interesting niche membership management software that acts more like a website integration specifically for communities of peers, industry colleagues or education alumni. This, in turn, gives it fewer features than a typical membership management software, but in the end, it provides more concise value to its target audience. Universities, industry academies and trade schools could benefit wildly here. It's also completely white-labeled.

<strong>Pros</strong>: Hyper-focused product on alumni, so the features reflex granularly refined value to customers.

<strong>Cons</strong>: Less features than one might expect.
<h2 id=""membee""><a href=""https://www.membee.com/"">Membee</a></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16291 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Membee.jpg"" alt=""membee"" width=""767"" height=""492"" />

Membee plays the part of a CMS for organizations, mostly non-profits, by offering website features like member portals, donation gateways, but also alongside a CRM and email communication set of tools. The non-profit focus allows for customers to find other ways of fundraising. It's not clear how the CMS works exactly until you've subscribed to them, but it seems to be very customer-success heavy. Which can be a good thing.

The pricing is extremely reasonable for a monthly subcription of 88USD per month, and that's it. No pricing packages, pay walls, or setup fees (unless you want to make a website from scratch with them.)

<strong>Pros</strong>: Extremely reasonable prices.

<strong>Cons</strong>: Lack of mobile apps, or member profile engagement within the portal. (that we know of)
<h2 id=""engageams""><a href=""https://engagesoftware.com/"">Engage AMS</a></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16289 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ENGAGEAMS-1024x433.jpg"" alt=""engage ams"" width=""1024"" height=""433"" />

Engage Software is an association-specific membership management toolset that offers a CRM, Email marketing, and online payment solution, but misses the market for event tools, which is a big pain point for anyone who runs events, which is most associations. The bigger pain point here is the price tag, at 6000USD annually, and 8000USD for the first year, it's not price-sensitive for smaller associations, though to be fair it doesn't paywall, limit allowances, or chop up features or limitations into packages, it's just a flat yearly fee.

<strong>Pros</strong>: Lots of integration and backend support, no paywalls.

<strong>Cons</strong>: Lacks some key features associations need while asking for a premium price tag.
<h2>That's a wrap</h2>
All in all these tools mentioned here are all coming from the same core tool, a CRM. It's how each tool adds onto this core that a true valuable software suite starts to bloom. For the specifics of membership management software and normal CRMs like Salesforce, Pipedrive, Hubspot, etc, the reality is that they're the same. Albeit with some features that run askew. It's how your needs evolve over time and how well you know your pain points that should determine one tool over another.

The needs of organizations are pretty different as you start to go from market to market. While one region may prefer mobile registration over another, in the end, the options are at your disposal and it's best to look at your members and see how far the rabbit hole they've gone in terms of engagement with your organization.

Are they not engaged enough? Run more events. How are you going to manage running more events? You probably need to look into MRMs that support event management. High membership turnover? Maybe it's time for a tool that knows about your member's actions and demographics.

This list is far from perfect and will likely get dated quite quickly, but that's the nature of good product launches in this industry. The more these tools offer, the better you can compare and contrast. We'll do our best here at EventBank to keep this up to date for your window-shopping needs.

2934,"Chamber Management Software: 7 Great Tools","Chamber management software is one of the most niche solutions on the web. But you're here, and you're reading this, so it's probably up your alley. Stick with our words of wisdom when it comes to selecting the right tool for your chamber management needs, and you'll walk away more informed than when you started reading.

Event Management Software, Membership Management Software, and even just plain old CRMs are all orbiting different niche industries trying to be as general as possible to make everyone happy. That's all fine and dandy, but as pain points become more and more of a talking point, it comes down to these tools to either provide a solution, or a workaround, most of which vie for the latter.
<h2 id=""top"">What makes Chamber Management Software Different?</h2>
Chambers and Associations are more inter-personal than a regular event-attendee or business-customer relationship. Chambers are a community and industry-focused societies that are there for each other, and the only true way to make a Chamber stand out in their regional markets is the amount of <i>trust</i> they can express to their new members.

Here are the 8 greatest Chamber Management Software solutions we could find for your window-shopping pleasure.

At EventBank we've been narrowing our aim year over year with the EventBank Chamber and Association management solution. Originally an event management and marketing tool, EventBank collected all the main-stay tools so that marketing and events teams can <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/8-best-event-management-software/"">run events and manage attendees</a>.

That means we built up our own ecosystem of CRM, Email Marketing, Website Creation, Ticketing, and much more. Through market-after-market of success, we soon found ourselves with our first real challenge, a Chamber of Commerce looking to become a customer. Of course, the platform was ready for events, but what about relationship-based memberships?

We had two choices, either turn them away and move on or, evolve and meet the needs of this growing demand, becoming a true chamber management software solution.

Of course, we would choose the latter. With a few updates here and there, the EB platform was ready to go, and soon we were able to start serving chambers. But what were the big changes we made? Was it the UX? No, UX can be updated for any use case. Was it the speed of the platform? Could be, but that benefits our events customers too.

No, it was the relationship-based contact management system. Chambers require trust to be successful in their goals, and with that in mind, the biggest transformation on the EB platform was the inclusion of high-detailed contact modules that allows Chambers not only go get analytics from their digital management but also to draw demographics and insights from interactions with their members.

That means the CRM that you populate with member data translates to all other aspects of the platform, automatically personalizing your event management at every level from merge tags to dues reminders and event suggestions.

Chamber Software is quite literally chamber software. It's an amalgamation of the best tools for use on any chamber website but works more like a cookie-cutter platform for chambers. While they may help out small chambers who are price-sensitive, it may not be a match for those that require more brand-awareness with their community.

However, for those that are not shy about putting their site upon a platform that's off their own domain, then Chamber Software is a pretty darn good option. With a wide array of tools, you'll have the ability to manage a community, set up event pages, ticket, send emails, and automate dues and renewals all from one platform.

The only one solution I would wish to see on their list is automation for membership renewals and dues payment reminders. Aside from that, the platform is pretty spot on, if you can swallow the hefty one-time setup fee, the monthly price is affordable for those that are not already paying to develop their own website, use email marketing tools, and so on.
<h2 id=""chambermaster""><a href=""//chambermaster.com"">Chamber Master</a></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2938 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Chamber-Master.jpg"" alt=""Chamber Management Tools"" width=""740"" height=""416"" />

Chamber Master is a chamber management software suite that is intending to leverage it's data management to improve the experience of managing large lists. There are indeed public-facing features like directories and blogs, and a really good members portal that can be utilized to create great online communities.

Events, news, and blogs are automatically updated and any edits are updated in real time, so Chamber Master also plays the role of CMS at some level as well.

The real use case and value Chamber Master puts forth is its ability to simplify your data, and bring it all in one place. You won't find a CRM that integrates with any tools, so you'll have to decide whether or not to hop from an older service to ChamberMaster, and with the scarcity of chamber software in the industry, it's an easy choice to move to Chamber Mater.

You'll still need to host events, ticket, send emails and automate your public facing needs with other tools, but you'll need to work with the integrations team to get that set up for your suite.

Web hosting is available but it's not very clear how easy the integrations are made if you're using a third party website. The good news is ChamberMaster's web services provide clean and professional web pages that will work more natively with their platform.
<h2 id=""chambernation""><a href=""//chambernation.com"">Chamber Nation</a></h2>

Chamber Nation is a hard-core chamber management software tool that runs in the same realm as EventBank Chamber and Association solution. That means there's a whole love of chamber management features under the hood like the tried and true CRM and databases and web hosting.

However, its truest value comes from its e-commerce support, allowing the chamber to host their own online stores on their chamber websites, eking more revenue for chambers who host free and public events more than paid ones, or member-only events.

The other great aspect of Chamber Nation is its ability to create a truly mobile-first experience by leveraging in-app messaging to engage members and remind dues and renewals. Web hosting seems to be a basic feature but for true integrations, it seems there's, of course, going to be some negotiation involved.

Chamber Nation's subsidiary Chamber Organizer is a full-service version of the software for chambers who want to leave the setup and management process to the professionals.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2937 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Chamber-Dashboard.jpg"" alt=""Chamber Management"" width=""554"" height=""402"" />

Chamber Dashboard is a full-stack web hosting utility with a specific focus for hosting chambers and associations. Not exactly a chamber management software suite of tools, but more of a whole host of add-ons and plugins for popular WordPress themes, even having themes of their own. Free users can enjoy a suite of hosted databases and a CRM with near-limitless access so long as they start their chamber hosting with Chamber Dashboard.

Meanwhile, other key features like Email Campaigns are locked behind one time payments that are typically below $100 each.

For those that are looking to start their chamber's web presence with a full suite of native features, Chamber Dashboard may be the best option. However, it's important to know that each addon is provided by Chamber Dashboard.

Another important thing to take note is that some features they provide are not really features. Some add-ons and plugins provided by Chamber Dashboard are really just integrations in disguise. For instance, ticketing and online payments is a free integration on any other web hosting service, meanwhile Chamber Dashboard locks this off on their web hosting platform with a paywall of $39.

You're also probably better off hosting your CRM with another provider as they also lock off both Importing and Exporting bulk data behind $39 for each feature. Both of which are free on all CRMs available on the web, even on some free CRMs.
<h2 id=""chamberdesk""><a href=""//chamberdesk.com"">Chamber Desk</a></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2940 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ChamberDesk.png"" alt=""Chamber Management Solution"" width=""500"" height=""270"" />

Chamber Desk is a great chamber management software platform for web-hosting not due to its features, but due to its rich content marketing network that it provides. The core features are all there, web hosting, CRM, event hosting, ticketing, and so on. But the real value comes from its inter-business communication and content marketing with its vast arrays of Journalists. So Chambers looking for early-on promotion may want to check this out first.

A feature I saw on here that I didn't see anywhere else is SMS marketing. How cool is that? Most of the time SMS marketing would be a premium level feature for even the most famous of Email Marketing tools out there. Very cool. Fees do apply, however. Packages range based on the number of members a Chamber wishes to host, and they scale quite well in my opinion.

However, one important thing to note is the amount of web storage that is limited to early on users are just under 5GB. While this may not be an issue, age will tend to grow a web page's server file storage, especially when it comes to massive database entries and image-based advertisements, as well as video hosting.

It may be entirely possible to his this storage limit even if your memberships stay under the maximum for your package. Buyer beware if you seek to store a massive amount of database data on your website.
<h2 id=""ccassist""><a href=""//chamberdata.com"">CC-Assist</a></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2936 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CC-Assist.jpg"" alt=""Chamber Member Management "" width=""1658"" height=""900"" />

CC-Assist is another platform that goes down the EventBank path of solutions. It's a true all-in-one solution that provides any and all features a chamber might need, including CRM, Event Hosting, Ticketing, Email Campaigns, automation, and billing. The whole premise around CC-Assist is its experience in dealing with Chambers, due to its experience as a provider of services to chambers as far back as the 80s before it went digital. Bringing over decades of experience to the table and translate into your digital space.

The true downside of CC-Assist is it's dated user interface for not only the back end but as well as the front end. Limited options leave you with a cookie-cutter website that doesn't blend well with most modern expectations.

The mobile app, a separate cost that's available for purchase, is better, but is just used for back end users only, and not for an in-person ticketing strategy. That is not to say that users cannot purchase tickets however, and users can very much purchase tickets online prior to events.

The other harrowing issue is that the software really is software. It's not a web app, and so it cannot be accessed at any time. The program must be downloaded securely. The only real way to let remote team members access the software is to load it onto a virtual server for remote access into one account. A painstaking solution to this issue and one that could be made better should it ever move into a web app interface with better UX.
<h2>The Sum of it All</h2>
Chamber management software solutions are not in a readily handy supply. Other suites of tools out there for fewer niche organizations are providing some of the best services and competitors are fighting either a price or a feature war with each other.

But for the more niche Chamber demand, the competition is not very high and those that are in the game can be quite dated, to be frank. However, some tools we went over in our list are pretty top notch and provide value where it's needed, so it's best for a chamber to look at its own needs before it goes shopping around, as few <a href=""//get.eventbank.com/chamber-management-software"">all-in-one solutions</a> exist.

We suggest looking at your web presence firstly, as the focus on CRM and Membership Management is quite lacking in the current tools aside from a select few. Web presence is the focus of even some of the original chamber management software tools so it's best to start there.

What do you need? An integration? Or looking to completely rebuild your digital self? Answering these questions early on is key for any Chamber to really make the most out of their software investments.

<h2 id=""topic"">1. Set Your Event Topic and Goals</h2>
Choose an appropriate topic for your event. It's that simple....or is it?

While industry-related events are easy to come up with for topics, you'll realize soon enough you aren't the only apple in the bunch that's going to host an event related to your industry. So you not only need to choose a topic related to your industry, but it has to blow your competition out of the water. Unfortunately, there is not much breathing room for an event's medium. It'll have speakers, round tables, discussions, Q&amp;As, Tabling, and a few other engagement related activities.

To make the most of your event, make sure the topic is <strong>relevant</strong> to the industry and <strong>up-to-date</strong>. You wouldn't want to be hosting a FinTech summit and completely avoid cryptocurrencies in your activities and discussions. You'd be missing out completely on what's in the news and the talking points of your industry. Do your due diligence and make the most out of your audience's curiosities. It's ok to be a little off-topic if it means driving interest as well, what you're looking for is a way to get people talking about your event.
<h3>Set a Goal</h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1558 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Group-101212@2x.png"" alt=""event ROI"" width=""1100"" height=""236"" />

What's the goal of your event? Is it ROI? (We certainly hope it is). Engagement? Networking? Even Free events have some sort of value in mind, even if it's not directly from ticket sales, make sure your audience provides your organization value in some way. Possibly by subscribing to newsletters, sharing the event on social media, and other tertiary ways of giving you value. That means revolving your event around ways your audience can engage with you, their fellow attendees, vendors, speakers, and most importantly, people outside of the event.

<b>ROI Goals - </b>Goals that revolve around a real dollar ROI are simple in the conversion performance. How many tickets do you need to sell before you can pay the event off, and then-some? These types of goals can serve dual purposes like increasing engagement and so on, but with a paid ticket in mind, the content, goods, or services you're providing need to be enough to make attendees happy.

<b>Engagement Goals - </b>Engagement goals are tertiary goals that have everything to do with getting your name out there or setting your organization up to be the leader of your industry. This means making your event set up so that attendees feel the need to tell others how great it is. Essentially it's just a big PR or marketing event. These can be paid, but it's best to leave them free to drive as much foot traffic as possible, or as much as your venue will allow.

<b>Networking Goals - </b>Networking events are typically smaller, though they don't have to be, due to the more personal nature of the event. Like a mixer or a round table discussion, these events focus on providing value to your attendees by getting them face to face with their peers or leaders in their industry they would otherwise never meet outside of your event. This goal benefits you as you'll become the go-to host for networking services and can both be an engagement goal or money goal facilitator.

And you know what? Sometimes your event might just want to meet all these goals and more. And that's alright.

The best thing for you to do now is to figure out who your audience is that matches your Topic and Goal.
<h2 id=""persona"">2. Create an Audience/Attendee Persona</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1525 size-medium"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/crm@2x-300x288.png"" alt=""CRM, event ROI"" width=""300"" height=""288"" />

This one is more of a marketing best practice, but it certainly fits nicely within event planning. So what's a persona? A persona is a make-believe attendee who embodies your attendee's core traits, wants, demographics, and skills.
<h3>Let's practice.</h3>
You're a CPA firm in New York who's looking to host an event for accounting students so you can drive a new <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/recruitment-event-ideas/"">recruitment initiative</a>. Your goal here is to be networking. The event should be free and accessible. So how's your attendee persona?

We'll name them Accounting Alex.

Alex is around 21-24 years old, a university senior, or recent graduate.
Alex should be located in New York or New Jersey. Alex should be a CPA holder or in the process of receiving their CPA.

That's a pretty good persona already. There can be much more related topics added to your attendee persona to help round out your audience. You can also add multiple different personas to the table. For instance, you can add Finance Frank for students who are Finance related but may switch to an accountant role for their career. Thusly you would create a persona for that person as well. Personas help with targeting your audience down to key areas and help you advertise to specific groups of potential attendees, even at the digital level.
<h2 id=""budget"">3. Event Budget Planning</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2047 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/rawpixel-683571-unsplash.jpg"" alt=""member engagement"" width=""1620"" height=""1080"" />

Now that you know your audience, your topic, and your goals, use this info to budget around them. Here's what you should factor in: Venue, A/V, Marketing, Swag, Vendors, and Furnishing

It's tough for us to give you the exact weight each of these factors brings to the budgeting table. It all really depends on your audience and what works best for them. If your audience is looking for being engaged with each other, put more budget into venues and furnishing. Is your event product-related? Throw more budget at A/V, Swag, and Marketing. Is the event more about the experience of being there? Give your Venue and Vendors a larger chunk of the pie.
<h2 id=""venue"">4. Planning Your Venue and Event Date</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2177 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/international_4.jpeg"" alt=""event management, international, globalization, event planning"" width=""1350"" height=""670"" />

The Venue and Date are the only things you really need before you can get started telling everyone about it. So let's get that out of the way.
<h3>The Venue</h3>
Now that you know what kind of budget you're looking to work with, it's time to hunt for a good venue. With your expected number of attendees, make sure the venue has all the necessary space required and is easily accessible for anyone to get to. The space also needs to be a reflection of your event's activities. Make sure there are divisions for break out areas, tabling, open spaces for talks, seats for attendees weary of standing all day (a must-have if you ask us).

Double-check data services to make sure there's a strong signal, but even if there is, always provide WiFi at the venue. Nothing makes the digital age of event attendees happier than WiFi. Event planning revolves around making sure the venue is comfortable and easy to manage, so first try searching for venues that specialize in hosting events often, as they're quite pliable when it comes to changing circumstances.
<h3>The Date</h3>
Choosing the date is a simple task but extremely key to your event's success. Simply do some research and make sure there are not other events related to yours in the vicinity. If there are, avoid those dates within 30 days of the other event to avoid splitting your audience or entering a marketing war.

OR

You could host your event nearby the day before or after the other event. That way attendees can attend both events within a short time-frame. Only do this if your events are in the same industry but the topics vary wildly so as not to conflict with each other. This could also open up great opportunities for co-sponsored events with other change-makers, lightening everyone's load.

Potentially you could even reach out to do a joint event, increasing your promotion reach. Having a partner helping in the event planning process takes a lot of pressure off your shoulders, so it's something we always suggest.
<h2 id=""marketing"">5. Marketing Your Event</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-973 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Chamber-Website-Solution-on-Mac-e1507197574808.png"" alt=""Chamber Website Solution on Mac, chamber website builder, chambers of commerce, ChamberMaster, WildApricot"" width=""522"" height=""351"" />

Marketing the event is now the job at hand. This will take anywhere from weeks, or even months ahead of the event depending on how marketing heavy your audience requires. The most important aspect of marketing is knowing exactly how to reach out to your audience. As well, where is your audience coming from? Are they local attendees? Are they flying in?

The range of your attendees is going to dictate your method of madness when it comes to marketing your event. Local attendees may require local SEO marketing with physical marketing hybridized. While longer range attendees may require a mostly digital approach to getting your event out there.

Let's get one thing straight, though.

No one answers phones anymore. Ever since 2007, people have been sending more text messages than answering phone calls. Don't even bother getting on the phones unless your audience is solely 40+ years old in demographics.

Here's where you start:
<h3>Social Media</h3>
Get your organization on social media if it already isn't. If your event resonates with your audience, people will share it with their friends as well. So don't miss the opportunity, post your event and make sure it gets around. You don't need a huge following as the real purpose of social media is to create posts that come from you, the organizer, so that way your vendors and speakers (who also want more attendees to show up) can share your content around their networks, or simply hashtagging it so it can start trending.

Some Tips for each channel include:
<strong>LinkedIn</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Join related industry groups in LinkedIn. Engage in other discussions so moderators don't kick you out for self-advertising. Once you have some leverage, this is a good place to share your event related to your industry.</li>
 	<li>Hashtag and @ certain individuals involved in the event, like speakers, who would love to share this content too.</li>
 	<li>Try to post once per 2 or 3 days from your organization account, while getting more frequent as the date gets closer.</li>
 	<li>If online ticketing is a conversion metric for your event, stay away from LinkedIn ads unless you know for sure your audience is active in their demographics, as CPV can get expensive for those of you who are looking for an ROI goal.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Facebook</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>If you're using Facebook, this is a great place to share casual content about your event. Facebook ads are cheap and a great way to target demographics at a CPC level.</li>
 	<li>Discuss topics with your audience, and give plenty of call to actions to share your content. Video content does really well in this aspect. The same for Linkedin as well.</li>
 	<li>Include Facebook Customer Chat to your event site so increase engagement with your organization and answer FAQs quickly. This is also a great way to increase your contact list on Facebook</li>
</ol>
<strong>Twitter</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Twitter is a great way to send short bursts of informative content. Gifs and images do really well at this aspect.</li>
 	<li>Users are typically more active and pliable on Twitter, so this is also an ideal place to @ your speakers and influences to get them to share. The beauty of Twitter is that comments act as a lower form of sharing, and they still get the content around.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Reddit</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Create a Reddit thread on subreddits related to your industry or local area. This is a great way to generate discussions and interest.</li>
 	<li>Avoid Reddit Ads. Having a trending post in the right subreddit does the same job.</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Online Ads</b></h3>
If you've got the budget for it, start sending ads around the web. This is especially helpful if your net is wide and your attendees are far. Google's Search Ads, Facebook and LinkedIn Feed Ads, and more are great ways to narrow your target audience down and make sure ads are getting in front of the eyes that matter.

Our biggest suggestion when it comes to ads on social media, however, is to create video content that's short, no more than 60 seconds. The first 3 seconds of the video must be engaging enough to capture someone's attention without any audio what so ever, as most social media channels these days autoplay videos on a feed without audio turned on. A “click” in this is actually whether or not a user has unmuted the video, showing they are engaged with the content. Those first 3 seconds are crucial to making sure your social ads are successful.
<h3><b>Web Presence</b></h3>
Make sure you have a web presence for your event. Whether it be a page on your website or a website for the event itself, make sure there is a way to capture your real-life leads into converted attendees that you have on a list somewhere. This is going to be important later. A web presence also helps give credibility to an event.

Unlike looking at an event on Meetup or Eventbrite, having your own event space means users set you aside from the rest like a real standalone entity taking itself seriously. You'll also want to make this place a great way to take on payments and deliver tickets to your prospects. This is going to save you a lot of headache at the front door of the event should you handle sign-ins correctly, which we'll get into later. You'll also have more control over content, design, and Call to Actions that make it easier for users to convert into attendees.

<h3><b>Event Email Marketing</b></h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3292 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Email-Campaigns-Ad-Copy@2x.png"" alt=""event email marketing guide"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

This is where that attendee list comes in handy. Attendees should be engaged before they arrive. you want to make sure that they are excited about the event so much so that they invite their friends and colleagues too. There's no harm in informing and surprising your attendees before they arrive.

Email marketing is also a great way to convert lists you might already have on hand. Use automation to make your life easier as you schedule emails to go out monthly if you're months away from the event, and weekly in the 5 weeks prior. Use this chance to inform and educate attendees about the event for a really smooth sign in and orientation process. We even made a list of some <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/event-email-marketing-strategies/"">great email campaign ideas</a> to use in your next event email campaign.
<h2 id=""equipment"">6. Know Your Equipment Needs</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-631 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Business-Event-Planning-Web.jpg"" alt=""event equipment list "" width=""1626"" height=""1080"" />

These days going digital means also bringing digital to your event as much as it means bringing your organization to the internet. No matter how traditional your event is, using the right equipment and technology at your event could make or break your impact on your attendees. This can be using multiple flat panel screens and projectors so audiences at talks can see the speaker from any distance, recording and live streaming the event for remote audiences, printing out “smart” IDs, and more.

In fact, the most important tech investments are those examples we just gave. If you can record the event and share it, make it easier for attendees to see and hear speakers, and easier for them to sign in, the whole event just went from B to A+. Do some research on the tools necessary, rent screens, microphones, recording equipment, any and all A/V you need. Or hire an outside entity to do it for you (the easiest approach).

Event planning depends on proper facilitation for speakers and attendees to enjoy activities held in the event, so it's important to know where the equipment's role is at every level, from registration to speaking.
<h2 id=""vendors"">7. Gather Vendors</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2054 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/imgo-2.jpg"" alt=""event vendors"" width=""800"" height=""533"" />

Getting your event to the next level, we're talking A++ now.

Vendors are going to make the difference between a good event, and a great event. You could possible staff your event entirely at all levels, but vendors have the resources and the manpower to get it done both effectively, and professionally. That means catering, sign in &amp; queuing A/V management, and more. Not only this but if your event is networking or product-focused, this is a good time to allow vendors to promote and sell their products and services at tables outside or surrounding the event area.

Vendors are a great way to leverage interests from your audience and allow for some padding for your organization to stuff swag bags, promote other offers, and negotiate mutually beneficial marketing agreements so you can have your vendors promote the event as well.

One other thing is that vendors extend to outside the event as well. If you're expecting a bunch of outside fly-in attendees, try to make some deals with the local hotels for pricing discounts, and transportation from hotel to the event doesn't hurt as well.
<h2 id=""registration"">8. Registration and Ticketing</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-628 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Check-Ins.jpg"" alt=""Event Registration Tips"" width=""984"" height=""406"" />

The Registration process is one of the most important aspects of your event that should be taken seriously from the beginning. This is the first impression of the event for your attendees and if this is run poorly, then they're just going to complain. I do it. You do it. We all do it. No one likes standing in line for a simple sign-in procedure.

The first place registration begins is online. This ties into your web presence, even if you don't outright own your own piece of the web for your event. Event third-party ticketing sites do wonders, as you can expect attendees to bounce from the event if they show up and realize the entire line at the door is waiting to pay, making it a slow-moving process.

The best way to get this process as painless as possible is to move it to become more digital of course. Doing so allows the ticketing process to be completed before the event even starts. This also allows for quick bar code and QR code scanning to confirm the registration long before you have to break out a list and search for their name, something I consider a cardinal sin among event planners. It's easy to achieve this these days with literally any event management tool or platform, so shop around for the one that works for you, we suggest anything with app support to facilitate self-service tablet registrations at the door.

The fewer folks you have waiting to buy a ticket on the day of the event, the better. There's a lot that can be done to make registration easier, so here's a list.
<ol>
 	<li>Create 2 registration lines, one for same-day ticket purchases and registrants, and one for online event ticket purchases. The online registrants lines should only consist of 1 or 2 steps to expedite the process, 1 for scanning their bar code/QR code, and optionally another step for collecting their badge/receive bracelet. Having 2 separate lines will make it so same-day ticket purchasers feel as though they should have registered online, allowing for more online registrants for follow-up events.</li>
 	<li>Ensure a strong WiFi connection, or have an offline sign up backup plan. Make sure attendees who lose connection, or forget their ticket/log in info, have a way to register by checking their name on a list. If a registrant forgets his information, or has lost connection to the registration app/website, bring that person out of the line and to a customer service table for checking their name on a list.</li>
 	<li>Set up FAQ lines that answer questions for attendees early on to prevent unnecessary questions at the registration table, holding up the line.</li>
 	<li>If you have the budget, set up self-serve registration tablets separate from the other registration lines, to further free up line clog and staff.</li>
 	<li>Offer free pamphlets and brochures to attendees or potentials waiting in line to purchase. Providing a schedule of events going on that day with special offers inside, for instance discounts on purchases with a vendor via said brochure, you can then guarantee more purchases.</li>
 	<li>Get an overabundance of stationery like pens, sharpies, paper, etc. Don't ever be caught with your pants down.</li>
 	<li>As a rule of thumb, set up one registration line per 100 guests, this will bring the wait time down to below 10 minutes per guest.</li>
 	<li>Work with your vendors to create swag bags that attendees can pick up right after they sign in. It's a great way to please a guest and gives you ample opportunity to stuff each person with marketing materials and goodies that will leave the event eventually and start spreading around. I also suggest T-shirts as they're great re-usable swag that might catch someone's attention.</li>
</ol>
At EventBank we really do take the registration and ticketing process seriously, it's the icing on the cake of event planning and management. It's the make or break it portion of an event, and it just so happens it's the first step for all attendees engaging with you. <strong><a href=""//www.eventbank.com/platform/payments-processing/"">Check out</a></strong> our product features for handling event ticketing to learn more.
<h2 id=""postevent"">9. Post-Event Marketing</h2>
Once the event is over, the value doesn't stop there. With all the registrations and attendees, you've now likely got a sizable list of contacts. Depending on the goal of your event, there's likely going to be value in you reaching back out to these attendees.

They're engaged already and they've experienced your events. Now is the best time to use a social media and email campaign to call these people to action to help give feedback, share their experiences, photos, or videos, and reach out to them again later for future events.

Oh, and send them a survey of course. Get some feedback to make your next event even better!

The new CRM update is the latest enhancement to the EventBank platform that finally ties all of our suite of tools together into one cohesive membership and event management experience.

The update includes further internal integrations to our CRM, Email Campaigns, Finances and Events Modules. Changing your statistics into actionable metrics.

This lets you fully automate reminders for membership renewals and dues payments, but this time personalizing each reminder via the contact's CRM profile, making it more likely to keep your paying members.
<h2><b>Why the All-in-One Method?</b></h2>
There's a good amount of tools out that there that could potentially make your life easier when it comes to event management. Sure, you could use them, but they're singularly focused in their respective fields. CRM providers manage your contacts. Email providers can make your campaigns clean and slick. And CMS's like wordpress can help you put up an event page with some relative ease. Meanwhile ticketing partners pocket the globe for a chance to take a piece of your pie.

But if you're hosting events and have a membership headcount to manage these tools will get cumbersome. You'll need to spend time, trial, and error to figure out which one works best for events, and <i>then </i>figure out if they integrate together properly. With EventBank, we made the tools you need that are:
<ol>
 	<li>Specific to membership based organizations</li>
 	<li>Natively integrated tools for a seamless digital experience</li>
</ol>
EventBank was founded by those in your exact situation. We think from an <i>organizer's </i>perspective. Hosting events, managing members, and engaging them were a tall order for organizations with no digital tools supporting them. With this in mind, our founders set out to upgrade chambers, associations, and more with the technology that takes the guess work out of running your events and managing members.
These headaches fuel our constant development and iteration of our platform.

So much so that we want to give you a sneak peak into the changes coming to the platform this month.",,1970-01-01,post,http://blog.eventbank.com/?p=3028,http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/21d3a662-d706-45db-be07-d6688a019103.png,21d3a662-d706-45db-be07-d6688a019103,,,"EventBank Update",http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/21d3a662-d706-45db-be07-d6688a019103.png,,"News &amp; Press Releases",,English,,draft,25,robert,robert.rafferty@eventbank.com,Robert,Rafferty,,,,0,0,0,open,open,2019-01-21

<h2 id=""top"">A Brief History of Association Management Software</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3032 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/worcester-guildhall-3539329_1920.jpg"" alt=""Association Management Software"" width=""1620"" height=""1080"" />

Association management can trace its roots all the way back to the middle ages when craftsmen and merchants grouped themselves into similarly processioned skilled labor called Guilds. Guilds were loosely formed of volunteers that aimed to organize their industry and profession so that they may learn from one another and pass on skills to friends and apprentices.

Management of these guilds were undertaken by guild masters and volunteer administrative staff that managed who was or was not a member of the guild, hold events for locals to attend in order to expose more consumers to the tradesmen of the guild, and when things got more exclusive, to collect dues from guild members to ensure membership.

Guilds eventually matured and evolved into the modern day university system, chambers of commerce, trade unions, associations, and clubs, using a similar format of management until the computer and internet age. At this point in time, membership was no longer locked to the locals who could attend physical events, meetings, and lectures.

The internet allowed members to join from around the country, or even around the world. Members could be informed of and kept informed of the association's events, news, and more all while being billed without the need of physical mail. This changed the checkerboard for the management's role in an association forever.

This is where association management software stepped in. Originally just a mess of excel sheets, entrepreneurs saw the value in combining all the necessary tools into platforms that serve for a digital translation of association management.

<h2 id=""messaging"">Exclusive Messaging and Offers</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2619 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/CMO-Series_AI_20181121_00019.jpg"" alt=""Association Management Strategies"" width=""1620"" height=""1080"" />

When it comes to associations, the prime goal of management is like any other member-based organization. Increase new members, and keep existing members. To do so requires strategic messaging and offer standpoint. That means you as the management need to offer something that is exclusive to members of your organization.

It all starts with what you can offer to your members that they cannot easily find elsewhere. Depending on the type of association you are, generally, you'd be serving a sector of industry or profession. This is the point at which you must prevail among all others. You need to have a good network with your industry's leaders and influencers. Only then could you really bring something to the table in the form of exclusive offers to members.

This is where events play a large part in their valuable role. Events act as both an incentive's offer for current members and as a way to entice non-members into joining should the event speak to their desires.

The events you run should be either exclusive members or inclusive to non-members. And it's events themselves that act as a beta-test for your association's ability to split into different levels of memberships. This is a great way to make the most of your member's engagement. Running events that allow members to interact with their counterparts and industry leaders is pretty much the main entree you can offer, but even then you can use different tactics like early bird and VIP membership pricing for limited time offers.

Combining this strategy with any one of the major association management software tools is paramount to helping your success in both obtaining and retaining new members. For example at EventBank, we give complete membership control to the user who can then create pricing models that work for their audience, including the ability to offer discount codes, create packages, and more for both memberships AND events. <a href=""//www.eventbank.com/solutions/association-chamber-management-cloud/"">Learn more here.</a>
<h2 id=""personalization"">Complete and Total Personalization</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3034 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/letters-2794672_1920.jpg"" alt=""Association Email Marketing"" width=""1920"" height=""480"" />

Members are the lifeblood of your association. You need to show them the kindness they deserve for being a loyal patron of your association and the best way to do that is simply to personalize their experience with you. This includes when promoting items and messaging to users via email.

“it's the thought that counts” really does apply to this situation. And you'll need association management software that helps get this across more than ever. In the CRM and Email Marketing world, we call this a merge tag, or custom variable. This applies to association management software, as all these tools have one thing in common.

Everything runs on lists.

A list is important for record keeping and knowing how to find your contacts, sure. But their real value comes from other tool's ability to call on each individual cell from the corresponding columns and rows that belong to each contact.

This allows email distribution tools to create fully personalized emails that cater directly to each member without having to start from scratch each time. For instance, each time you say Dear [first name], the first name of the contacts that belong to the email destination that the email campaign is being sent to, will populate the area in brackets. This can be done for the contact's industry, company, location, and literally anything else.

EventBank's platform is a suite of tools like many others out there that revolve around a core CRM. This CRM holds the list so that other tools in the platform can feed on it and take a custom variable and merge tag those variables in all outgoing communication. Make sure you use these customization options at all times to make the member feel understood.
<h2 id=""tracking"">Track Engagement for Each Member</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1574 size-medium"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/events-hero_2x-768x667-300x261.png"" alt=""association membership tracking"" width=""300"" height=""261"" />

Tracking a member's engagement is an important set of metrics that separate association management software from any old CRM suite. Without explicit knowledge of what events the member has attended, how many new members that member introduces to the organization, and so on, you'll miss out on what truly makes your organization stand out in terms of information gathering.

Association Management Software is indeed software, and that means everything you do in the real world should translate seamlessly to the digital world.

Tickets purchased online, member website profiles, email campaigns, and more are all traceable, and the ideal association management software for your association should be able to do this natively as well. You should ideally have the ability to see profiles of all your contacts, leads and members so you know who and what those individuals have done in your organization.

Maybe they sign up for events often, maybe they're consistently late on payments, maybe they are active in email campaigns. These sets of data give you both macro and micro vision into how your organization performs. Looking at a bird's eye view of your association, you should be able to see large swaths of member data so you can gauge your performance.

This isn't just vanity numbers either, this data is applicable to actionable tasks like email campaigns. For instance if you want to send out a survey email only to those in your association who attended a certain event, then you can easily generate a separate email list for accounts that have been registered at the event, because only profiles who registered at that event, would ever have that data tracked on their profile.

This also gives you the great opportunity of doing goodwill gestures to long-time members or highly active members, enticing them to stay longer, and instilling trust that your promise looks out for its members and indeed cares for their achievements.
<h2 id=""automation"">Automate Communication</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3035 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/email-3249062_1280.png"" alt=""association management software automation"" width=""1280"" height=""716"" />

Automating is the biggest buzzword there is today, and it's permeating every industry you can imagine. Automation saves time, money, and resources on doing mundane tasks that originally took an expensive workforce to complete.

This is not less true for association management software. While an all-in-one product that combines the necessary tools into one platform does indeed solve more than a few pain points, you won't really be eking out the most that this software has to provide until you realize that it's all still the same amount of work.

True value comes from the work you don't have to do. The less time you spend on tasks, the more time you can spend on more valuable tasks instead. If time equals money, then you should be spending your time like you should be spending your money. Communication is the key method of providing value to members in an association, so this should be the prime function that needs to be automated.

Automation comes in many formats, but the main automation that should always be taken into consideration is email automation. This will exponentially spread your message at the single click of a button and utilizes personalization merge tags as discussed before. Ideally, a full automation suite for emails would include custom sequences designed to send out depending on user actions like signing up for an account online, purchases, or others.

Another sort of automation, which may or may not be in email format, that is directly valuable to any organization with membership models, is the automation of reminders for dues and renewal payments. This directly affects the revenue turnover and is the prime area for automation.

Do not buy any association management software that lacks this feature, as it's a basic necessity to keep in the green. Using merge tags and member tracking tools, automation communication in the form of mainly emails, but could be SMS, Phone Calls, or other forms of communication can be then sent to the member based on time-frame triggers.

If it's 2 weeks from the expiration of a member's membership package, this would be where the association management software kicks in and send a renewal reminder to that member in hopes to get them to take action. Member late on a payment? Make sure a reminder gets sent to them so they can pay. It's a simple feature that relies on the other parts of the whole in order to trigger and automatically remind members. It's an easy way to keep the cash flow up to date without any dead members in your list.
<h2 id=""ecosystem"">Create an Ecosystem</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3036 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/user-trip-memberships@2x.png"" alt=""association management software overview"" width=""1285"" height=""749"" />

In order to truly make the most of your association management software, you need to submit to the idea that the software needs to penetrate all levels of your organization. All levels of your organization can indeed go digital. And this is an important stage of transforming your association.

When it comes to memberships, you, of course, want a list on an excel sheet somewhere. It's easy to use and easy to filter data. But this is only scratching the surface of the benefits of a digital world. You need to create a digital ecosystem for your association to thrive off of. Make sure that the first and last interaction with members is digital so you can track any and all major movements and metrics of your association.

As we said before, everything runs on lists. This acts at the core of your ecosystem, where any and all tools orbit and feed on.

The list holds all relevant data about your contacts, leads, and members, and the tools take from these contacts what it needs in order to personalize and automate the experience for you.

Emails need personalization from the merge tags, QR codes scanned when members attend events track it in that member's profile, and soon other tools will recognize this member attended said event, and start to personalize and automate communication themselves. It's an ecosystem that works to feed other parts and so on and so on.

At EventBank we do the same with our platform. By utilizing our CRM, contact data is not only kept but modified over time as user actions take place. Eventually, your ecosystem will start to churn out engaged, loyal, and new members without breaking a sweat.

Small events are a great way to create personable events that cater to an engaged few. No matter the context of the event, whether it's a roundtable, a luncheon, a talk, class, etc, the audience there is smaller, and the topic will be directly related to them. This means the event is less of a planning-heavy ordeal and more of a content and engagement ordeal. Due to the small nature of events at this size, the variety of event types is much larger as more context and options can be explored.

If you're planning 4-6 months in advance of the event, then it's likely going to be a much larger event. Let's start modestly at 3-4 months in advance of something like a workshop of sorts in mind.

Medium size events host attendees and guests in the low hundreds range, so the personalization of the event is less stringent, but in lieu of this, it becomes more important to provide well-oiled plans with a much more encompassing schedule of activities. The type of events may be similar but everything at this point is scaled up. More speakers, more time, larger spaces, more engagement, and better organization is key to scaling small events, into medium sized events.

Event costs and considerations come much earlier in the process than a small event, as mistakes, later on, could spell disaster for medium to large size events, where losing one aspect of your event in terms of negotiation and pricing, could end it before it even begins.

Of course after an event this large, you'll need to double check your finances of the event and make sure you can cover your costs.

This is usually done by sharing full video recordings, live streams, and media coverage.

3118,"5 Great Event Website Builders with Drag & Drop Editing","Hosting events these days isn't just a physical task, it's become a digital one as well. Your attendees are online every single day, and it's because of this fact of digital modern life, that you should be leveraging an event website builder that can help get your website it's very own automated events portal. You'll be able to let your users keep track of upcoming events, register, and get informed all within your website, but without all the hassle of developing new pages on your own and manually updating future events every time one comes up.
<h2>Why Use an Event Website Builder?</h2>
Events pages on websites are not like most other pages on your core site experience. Generally, web pages for business are quite static, with changes and updates made every month, or even annually. The need for a service to help manage these pages are not really needed. Event pages are a different story though. These pages have specific functions that need to feed into back-end tools that help to manage the event easier.

The page needs to be up to date in real-time with event date scheduling, ticketing and more. Users who register on these pages need to be fed into a CRM, and from there, start a chain reaction of promotional emails, reminders, and much, much more.

Event pages can be done by hand, but it's just not worth the effort, especially if you expect to be pumping out event-after-event. What you really need is a tool that's entirely focused on getting you a dynamic events page(s) that can take minutes to set up with simple drag-and-drop features.

We've picked out 5 awesome event website builders that let you create an entire events portal from scratch using drag-and-drop features that make managing these pages a breeze.

WordPress is the go-to CMS for all things website and page building if you know how to work it. WordPress is one of those things that if you know how to set it up juuuuust right, then you'll make mincemeat of any web project. Only, you'll run into the same issues that event pages have from the pure principal that they need to be kept up to date often. So, unless you feel like spending hours each week keeping your event pages up to date, here's how you can set up WordPress to become more like a drag-and-drop event website builder.
<h3>Choose a Visual Editor</h3>
In WordPress, unless you're an HTML code-monkey, there are a few add-ons that give you the drag-and-drop functions that are not readily available when you first install WordPress on your domain. Like Legos, WordPress sites can be mixed and matched with plugins and add-ons that help your site truly shine. (But don't go too overboard with plugins as some plugins may interfere with others and cause instability.)

The two main tools to start with are the ones that give you the ability to drag-and-drop elements of a web page, other elements strictly related to events can be added later on. *Elementor* and *WP Bakery *are both tools that are visual drag-and-drop web page editors that can be re-purposed into an event website builder.

Elementor is a more user-friendly editor that sacrifices precision for a truly visual inspection mode that makes changes in complete real-time to your web page. If you're good at eye-balling your changes, then this may be the easiest editor to adopt.

WP Bakery, however, is more of a precision-based model of event website building as it focuses on rows and usage of templates to give adequate spacing and coloring to the page as a whole. With both editors, an identical page can be made, but it depends on the usability that best fits the developer for it to really give its value.

Once you've got your visual editors all picked out, simply <a href=""//themeforest.net/category/site-templates?term=event%20management%20&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93#content"">choose a template</a> the best suits your event management needs, and go to town. The only thing to keep in mind at this point is that this method lacks CRM, automation, and any other necessary tools.

This list is not about event page builders that have these items, although some do, so do your due diligence and make sure your other tools like CRM and Email Marketing solutions can easily integrate with your new WordPress event pages.
<h2 id=""eventcreate""><a href=""//www.eventcreate.com/"">EventCreate</a></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3119 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/eventcreate.jpg"" alt=""evetncreate website builder"" width=""600"" height=""230"" />

EventCreate is strictly an event website builder that leverages a domain purchasing network that puts the power of the event website in your hands. This method is for those who are looking to have a straightforward event website based on a core template.

This is only really useful if you do not insist on changing your website much in the future, as it seems there will be quite a deep integration of the template into the HTML framework of the web pages. (Though for paid customers, CS representatives will help you integrate third-party tools to make it easier to reach goals.
<h3>The Builder</h3>
The EventCreate event website builder is certainly a visually pleasing tool, as it starts off with 3 simple questions that help get your page up to speed in no time. However, there is not much say you have in changing the template of the web page as customized pages and templates are for paid customers only. Otherwise, it's an extremely competent drag-and-drop interface that clearly highlights rows of content to make it easier to see your real-time changes.

For EventCreate, it's an easy to use platform that if there is no other alternative, or, if their templates suit you just fine, then it's the perfect choice until you feel the need to customize, where at that point, you need to decide whether to pay or to switch to a new website and effectively upgrade so that you might be able to integrate later on.

This is an especially frustrating situation as you'll be forced to pay for customization and integrations if you ever want to integrate tools you use like CRMs to your EventCreate site and it's forms.
<h2 id=""bizzabo""><a href=""//www.bizzabo.com/"">Bizzabo</a></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3122 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/bizzabo-website-builder.png"" alt=""bizzabo event website builder"" width=""828"" height=""525"" />

Bizzabo is an event and membership management platform that focuses on the digital side of hosting. This includes hosting a website that is built with their event website builder, and it feeds information off of current events to help build a dynamic website that updates as you host and expand events. Where Bizzabo excels is its use of a plethora of templates that look beautiful and fit well.
<h3>The Builder</h3>
Bizzabo's event website builder can be simply summarized as extremely simple. Almost too simple. Majority of the drag and drop features are not so much graphically concerned but are mainly widgets that are a reflection of different aspects of the platform.

It's as cookie cutter as you can get, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. If you know yourself well enough to understand you're not the best at designing web pages, Bizzabo's templates and widget style of drag and drop already do the legwork for you so you don't have to worry what looks best.

For branding options, you'll have to pay more than the base package, so that's something to consider. Otherwise, Bizzabo's event website builder is run-of-the-mill, but it's not a bad mill to be working at for the most part. The balance you'll need to find here is whether or not your users are susceptible to content, or graphics more, though, in our experience, content is king.
<h2 id=""aventri""><a href=""//www.aventri.com/"">Aventri</a></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3121 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/aventri-website-builder.png"" alt=""aventri website builder"" width=""1000"" height=""551"" />

Aventri is another one of those event &amp; membership management platforms that have the all-in-one approach to the solution of managing memberships, events, and promotion. This includes a well-to-do event website builder that puts the power of the event website into the palm of one's hand. The platform is complex but easy to manage with enough options to keep you busy for a good long while.
<h3>The Builder</h3>
Aventri's event website builder is coming from the same methodology of Eventbank and Bizzabo, but it's focusing less on the user's experience with template web pages and more on the style and development options. Taking the opposite route of Bizzabo's methodology.

The entire tool is drag and drop, but the settings for each module goes into incredible detail that makes it so you can adjust the smallest of settings for each module all the way up to global settings. This is for tech-driven event planners who seek to leverage the customization of the platform for perfected webpage SEO and design.

These items are often times a strategy to delight attendees from the outset of the event and serve to put smiles on their faces. You'll find swag and gift bags at functions like conferences, meetings, seminars, panel discussions, conventions, expos, and more.</p>
<h2>Swag Bag Ideas with Conversions in Mind</h2>
<p>Despite that it's 2020, I still feel the need to bash you over the head with the idea that you need to bring your offline leads to your online database in as seamless a transition as possible. When it comes to events, attendees are already engaged, and you simply need to find creative ways to call them into signing up, purchasing, booking a demo or whatever it is you need to get them on the hook.</p>
<p>Swag Bags are key in that a vast majority of attendees will be using your swag in their daily lives, which gets them familiar with your branding, and can call them to action. This is a great way to introduce new ways to get them to whip out their phone and get on your landing pages, whether it be an incentive or a QR code, or easy to follow link. Two important things to note about your swag is that they should be:</p>
<p><strong>Useful</strong> - Make sure your attendees find a use for it in their daily lives that causes them to see your brand or CTA.</p>
<p><strong>Long Lasting</strong> - Do not make anything that is disposable, you lose your branding sooner than you would hope, and it's unsustainable for the environment.</p>
<p>Make sure every bit of swag has your logo on it or some graphic that leads users to your website, or social media. This is a great way to convert them or get them to share your products online.</p>
<p>That means placing QR codes, easy to type URLs, and the name of your social media accounts they can Google easily. When dallying with QR codes or other ways to scan, make sure you have it lead to an awesome landing page that addresses the CTA you used, or the event that they attended. All 21 of our swag bag ideas are revolving around extending the lifetime value of your attendees but feel free to change things up so that it best fits your audience or event topic.</p>

<h2 id=""clothing"">Clothing &amp; Apparel Swag Bags</h2>
<p><img class=""notfull aligncenter wp-image-3156 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/download.jpg"" alt=""free event tshirt"" width=""225"" height=""225"" /></p>
<p>Clothing is one of the best swag bag ideas that are both useful and long-lasting. Everyone loves a free t-shirt, and there's an absolute ton of space for you to market and call your attendees to actions. The other benefit is that it really spreads your brand name around when attendees wear it outside.</p>
<p>Who knows? Maybe an attendee is a big public speaker and they just happen to speak to an audience with the t-shirt on? Maybe it's recorded on TV or a highly viral video? All that free marketing potential and it cost you less than it does to pay for your lunch.</p>
<p>For example, you could give away:</p>
<h3>1. T-Shirts</h3>
<p><img class=""notfull wp-image-15123 size-full alignnone"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1-dollar.png"" alt=""Cheap Swag Bag"" width=""30"" height=""30"" /></p>
<p>T-shirts are one of the most common, cost-effective, and brilliant ways to grow your brand. Using T-shirts as a platform for showing off your brand and logo is easy as everyone loves a free t-shirt. Just make sure it's not gaudy and turns off the attendee from ever wearing it in public.  The cost-effectiveness depends on the plausibility of printing t-shirts with the right sizes. So make sure you have a way to use an email system to get attendee's sizes via survey so that adequate sizes are ordered for the event. </p>
<p>You obviously can't put the right size in a swag bag unless it's been given a name and is pre-ordered so to speak. What you can do however is set up a referral booth for attendees to pick up their t-shirt in their right size. This can be verified by placing a voucher for 1-free t-shirt in the swag bag for the attendee to use and receive their t-shirt.</p>
<h3>2. Hats</h3>
<p><img class=""notfull alignnone wp-image-15124 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2-dollar.png"" alt=""Affordable Swag Bag"" width=""60"" height=""30"" /></p>
<p>Hats, much like T-shirts are a cost-effective brand platform. Men are more likely to wear hats when going outside, so events where there's an over-abundance of men. Hats are adjustable and can fit most heads, so there's no need to ask attendees their size before showtime.</p>
<h3>3. Slides/Flip-flops</h3>
<p><img class=""notfull alignnone wp-image-15125 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3-dollar.png"" alt=""high quality swag bag"" width=""90"" height=""30"" /></p>
<p>Slides and flip-flops are a more normal fashion accessory, and they make a great way to place logos. We prefer slides as they have more surface area on the arresting strap above the foot to place branding, and it faces upwards towards anyone looking at the slides in a normalized setting. Slides are more likely to be worn by men.</p>
<h3>4. Sunglasses</h3>
<p><img class=""notfull alignnone wp-image-15123 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1-dollar.png"" alt=""Cheap Swag Bag"" width=""30"" height=""30"" /></p>
<p>While not a great place for branding, sunglasses are a nice accessory to own. Small logos work well here.</p>
<h3>5. Tote-bags</h3>
<p><img class=""notfull alignnone wp-image-15125 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3-dollar.png"" alt=""high quality swag bag"" width=""90"" height=""30"" /></p>
<p>While tote bags are not being used in everyday life as a t-shirt, the growing number of bag-it-yourself grocery stores like Aldi's has made it so that tote bags are being brought into the sunlight more often than usual. Great place to place a logo or branding. Maybe enough room for a low-key CTA ;). Also great for events where attendees live nearby the beach.</p>
<h3>6. Wallets</h3>
<p><img class=""notfull alignnone wp-image-15123 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1-dollar.png"" alt=""Cheap Swag Bag"" width=""30"" height=""30"" /></p>
<p>Wallets are a men-centric accessory and a bit expensive. However, the life-long capability of the wallet ensures it'll be around for a good long while. </p>
<h3>7. Neck Pillows</h3>
<p><img class=""notfull alignnone wp-image-15124 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2-dollar.png"" alt=""Affordable Swag Bag"" width=""60"" height=""30"" /></p>
<p>Neck pillows are great for events where attendees have to fly-in. Slap branding or a logo on it, and now everyone on plane will have to look at your logo as they jealously wish they had their own neck pillow.</p>
<h3>The Strategy</h3>
<p>For apparel, the strategy is quite clear. Create great branding. Either by fancy showy graphics, CTAs, or a simple logo, it depends on how grandiose your event is. T-shirts and hats are one of the most visible types of clothing, so it's a great time to place your logo and create a CTA either with your slogan, or something that's impactful.</p>
<p>The other thing to keep in mind is that if your event is in Asia, it might be best to offer materials with QR Codes. If it's in China, I would say it's a downright crime if you don't add a QR code to your apparel. China loves the QR code thing, and it's starting to speak across the region in places like Hong Kong, Korea, and Singapore.</p>
<h2 id=""gadgets"">Gadget Swag Bags</h2>
<p><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3137 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/swag-bag.png"" alt=""swag bag ideas"" width=""749"" height=""505"" /></p>
<p>Gadgets are one of the best ways to convert attendees and get them from the real world into your digital database and CRM easily. Gadgets are also considerably more expensive, but if done right, can be very good at calling your attendees to an action that brings you closer to ROI.</p>
<p>The other great thing about gadgets is that no one will throw them away so easily, a phone charger here, headphones there, and there's almost a guarantee that this will be useful for the attendee.</p>
<p>Here are some neat-o examples:</p>
<h3>1. Headphones</h3>
<p><img class=""notfull alignnone wp-image-15124 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2-dollar.png"" alt=""Affordable Swag Bag"" width=""60"" height=""30"" /></p>
<p>Headphones are an awesome way to make every-day use items to expose your branding. This is also a great way to cross large age gaps as most anyone loves a nice pair of headphones. Even just to give away as a gift. It's difficult to brand there, but there's always value in expressing the origin of technology. Imagine people saying they got their headphones at your event, and now that person might be incentivized to come to your future events. </p>
<h3>2. Phone Chargers</h3>
<p><img class=""notfull alignnone wp-image-15125 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3-dollar.png"" alt=""high quality swag bag"" width=""90"" height=""30"" /></p>
<p>Phone chargers are another great way to expose branding. There's slightly more room for branding on the power adapter itself than say a pair of tiny headphones. </p>
<h3>3. Smartphone cases/pockets</h3>
<p><img class=""notfull alignnone wp-image-15123 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1-dollar.png"" alt=""Cheap Swag Bag"" width=""30"" height=""30"" /></p>
<p>By far one of the better ideas we can offer is the use of phone cases. It'll be tough and expensive to get a branded case into the hands of attendees, but if you can, imagine how often that phone gets whipped out with your logo on it? </p>
<h3>4. Battery Banks</h3>
<p><img class=""notfull alignnone wp-image-15123 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1-dollar.png"" alt=""Cheap Swag Bag"" width=""30"" height=""30"" /></p>
<p>Batteries are a slightly better version of power adapters. The trend for power banks is that they're becoming more phlatter to match the size of smartphones so that it rests easily into the palm of a user's hand, and then the phone sits above it. The nature of batteries being mobile makes it so it's more likely to have your branding or logo get seen as they get used in public areas. </p>
<h3>5. USB drives</h3>
<p><img class=""notfull alignnone wp-image-15124 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2-dollar.png"" alt=""Affordable Swag Bag"" width=""60"" height=""30"" /></p>
<p>USB drives are an always welcome tech-device to add into a swag bag. Not only can you brand the casing, but you can pre-load the USB drive so that when it's first inserted into a computer, it can either contain files that are relevant to the user's experience at the event, which of course would contain your branding. Or, it can also auto-load a webpage of your choosing on the first-insertion however this can easily backfire if the user is not properly engaged. Use caution. </p>
<h3>6. Power Adapter </h3>
<p><img class=""notfull alignnone wp-image-15124 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2-dollar.png"" alt=""Affordable Swag Bag"" width=""60"" height=""30"" /></p>
<p>Power adapters are just like phone chargers, except geared toward international travelers. This would be a welcome addition to your swag bags. </p>
<h3>The Strategy</h3>
<p>Gadget swag is dependent on the versatility of the objects. Providing cheap electronics can often time end up with a bad taste in the attendee's mouth if it breaks too soon, so make sure you do put some extra budget into your offering. Make deals with local manufacturers and get your logo imposed on the steel or printed on the plastics of electronics.</p>
<p>These days electronics are getting more IoT intensive. So I would suggest working with forward-thinking partners to allow for advertising on their app or linking to your website landing page when attendees connect their smartphone devices to the gadget they just got from your event.</p>
<p>If you don't have that ability, this is a chance to do a neat Google Ads campaign that targets the manufacturer's app on the Google Play store to advertise to attendees who download their app.</p>
<p>How's that for a growth hack?</p>
<h2 id=""stationery"">Stationery Swag Bags</h2>
<p><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3155 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/paperwork-3154814_1920.jpg"" alt=""swag bag stationery"" width=""1772"" height=""1080"" /></p>
<p>Stationery items are great swag bag ideas, but there's a core crutch to this that you should be aware of. It's in the name actually, in fact, it is the name. Stationery Items are stationary, unlike clothing or gadget items, these stationary items hardly leave a room they find themselves home in. It's not to say that it wouldn't be successful as a CTA medium, but it would likely only grace the eyes of attendees who use them.</p>
<p>The only exception honestly would be pens, as those seem to get around quite a bit from borrowing, losing, forgetting, giving away, etc.</p>
<p>Here are some more examples for you:</p>
<h3>1. Pens &amp; Pencils</h3>
<p><img class=""notfull alignnone wp-image-15123 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1-dollar.png"" alt=""Cheap Swag Bag"" width=""30"" height=""30"" /></p>
<p>Pens and pencils are a great way to brand yourself on a small, but effective scale. it's cheap, easy to handle, and almost always used to their fullest extent. You can even expect it to trade hands often. </p>
<h3><a href=""//www.qualitylogoproducts.com/custom-notebooks.htm"">2. Notepads</a></h3>
<p><img class=""notfull alignnone wp-image-15123 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1-dollar.png"" alt=""Cheap Swag Bag"" width=""30"" height=""30"" /></p>
<p>Notepads are a great item that has a fair amount of durability and usage. Either brand or logo on the cover, or inlaid as a watermark on each page. This also applies to sticky-notes. </p>
<h3>3. Calculators</h3>
<p><img class=""notfull alignnone wp-image-15124 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2-dollar.png"" alt=""Affordable Swag Bag"" width=""60"" height=""30"" /></p>
<p>Calculators are surprisingly cheap. You can brand them and expect a full continued usage of the item. Calculators have been known to last years, but often times does not trade-hands very well. </p>
<h3>4. Tumblers/Glasses</h3>
<p><img class=""notfull alignnone wp-image-15124 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2-dollar.png"" alt=""Affordable Swag Bag"" width=""60"" height=""30"" /></p>
<p>Tumblers and glasses are a great item for older generations who enjoy drinking the finer things in life. This is a great time to subtly impose your logo onto the glass. </p>
<h3>5. Kinetic Desk Toys (I love these)</h3>
<p><img class=""notfull alignnone wp-image-15125 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3-dollar.png"" alt=""high quality swag bag"" width=""90"" height=""30"" /></p>
<p>Kinetic desk toys are mesmerizing little desk ornaments that serve no real value other than attracting someone's divided attention. Imposing your logo on here is a great way to make the most of someone's stolen attention.</p>
<h3>6. Laser Pens &amp; Flashlights</h3>
<p><img class=""notfull alignnone wp-image-15124 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2-dollar.png"" alt=""Affordable Swag Bag"" width=""60"" height=""30"" /></p>
<p>Flashlights and laser pens are just like pens and pencils. They're fun to use, necessary, and people just love playing with them. Place a logo on it and watch it work. We suggest giving away ones with replaceable batteries, as one-time usage type lamps will just be thrown in the trash along with your logo. </p>
<h3>7. Coasters</h3>
<p><img class=""notfull alignnone wp-image-15123 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1-dollar.png"" alt=""Cheap Swag Bag"" width=""30"" height=""30"" /></p>
<p>At more social events, coasters are a great giveaway to the dads of the crowd.</p>
<h3>8. Sports Bottles</h3>
<p><img class=""notfull alignnone wp-image-15124 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2-dollar.png"" alt=""Affordable Swag Bag"" width=""60"" height=""30"" /></p>
<p>Sports bottles are a more friendly approach to the casual events where it's important to be child-oriented.</p>
<h3>The Strategy</h3>
<p>Stationery should be useful, and long-lasting because it's not the most travel-worthy type of swag, but it should spark a conversation. If you have a nice well-made tumbler with your logo imposed on the glass, it could possibly spark a conversation when the attendee breaks them out at a party or what have you. Think like a coca-cola glass. Its shape and logo are recognizable, and everyone asks about them.</p>
<p>Unlike gadgets, these types of items are easier and more common to <a href=""//www.vistaprint.com/"">custom print and embed logos</a> onto.</p>
<h2>Other Things to Throw In</h2>
<p>Swag bags aren't only made up of the above three items, but think about meaningful items to put in the bag to give early on impressions, like a welcome letter, candy, snacks, discount codes, and more. These are items that can fit in any swag bag no matter the strategy that gives a great first impression of the event.</p>
<p>There is more than enough room in any swag back to sprinkle them with temporary feel-good items that make an attendee feel welcome and happy instantly. Could be that that instant gratification alone gets them tweeting about you ;)</p>
<p>Take into consideration everything, but most of all, make sure that your giveaways call your attendees to some sort of action that makes your attendees convert. If it takes them to a web page, make sure you have a landing page that addresses the CTA or the Event.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MAJOR NOTE: Make sure your swag bag's bag is a backpack. Not an expensive one, but one of the string-laced bags that are easy to carry and wear. It makes a load of difference in the attendee's experience, especially if they're walking around the event a lot, and it also acts as a good way to increase your branding by putting your logo or CTA on the bag itself.</p>

3170,"EventBank Ramps Up Asia Pacific Expansion into 2019 with New Office in the Philippines","<i>Manila, Philippines (February 11, 2019)</i> – EventBank, the company behind the Asia's most recognized and award-winning <a href=""https://www.eventbank.com/"">membership and event management cloud software</a>, today announced the opening of their newest office in Manila, the capital of the Philippines. The new office in the country will enable EventBank to capitalize on and accelerate digital transformation, a part of it's asia pacific expansion campaign, by providing its software solutions to even more local and multinational organizations eager to adopt the newest technology.

In 2013, EventBank first started in the US and China followed by the Asia Pacific expansion in 2018, when it opened its Hong Kong and Singapore offices in an effort to extend EventBank’s global reach. Now, with offices in regional hubs of Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing and a growing network of partner offices like in Seoul and Moscow, EventBank plans to build even further on the tremendous growth that has already taken place in the Asia Pacific region. The new roles in the Philippines will span nearly all aspects of EventBank’s business including sales, marketing, services, and support.

According to the recent study by Microsoft and IDC APAC (<a href=""https://news.microsoft.com/en-ph/2018/02/14/digital-transformation-contribute-us8-billion-philippines-gdp-2021/"">link</a>) digital transformation will add an estimated US$8 billion to the Philippines’ GDP, and increase the growth rate by 0.4% annually by 2021. The same study expects around 40% of the Philippines’ GDP will be from digital products and services. These macro trends further highlight the optimistic forecast for the adoption of event and membership management solutions developed by EventBank in the coming months and years in the Philippines.

CEO and Co-Founder, Eric L. Schmidt, said “I’m proud of what EventBank has achieved across the Asia Pacific so far and our new office in Manila is another step to accelerate our growth in the region. There is a huge potential to help millions of organizations across the Philippines to become digital and more efficient with our all-in-one cloud solutions. I believe that we are only just scratching the surface of what we can achieve in this fast-growing region and we are excited to be one big step further on our mission to transform the professional communities with the new office in Manila.”

The opening of the new office in the Philippines will enable the EventBank team to be closer to the rapidly growing number of the customers and to engage new ones. Those that will be able to benefit from the new Manila office include existing customers using EventBank's <a href=""https://www.eventbank.com/solutions/association-chamber-management-cloud/""><i>Chamber of Commerce &amp; Association Management Software</i></a> and <a href=""https://www.eventbank.com/solutions/event-marketing-management-cloud/""><i>Event Management Software</i></a> such as American Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines, Bankers Association of the Philippines, Eventscape Manila, Global Links MP Events, European Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines or the Philippine Institute of Certified Public Accountants.

3214,"Event Spaces as a Service: Event Venues Going Digital","Event Spaces are no longer about square footage, or dividers, tables, and chairs. Event Spaces are <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/planning-events-growth-guide/"">going digital</a>, and that means you need to take advantage of this for your own benefit.

Businesses like yours are moving digital, you're likely using a CRM, email software, and a bunch of social media to generate buzz. If you're looking to run a physical event, in person, and at a very real location, it's hard to image digital being much more than sharing the event photos and takeaways after the fact. But you're wrong.

It's the spaces themselves that are going digital, and you'll want to listen in to how you take advantage of these shifting tides in physical event space real-estate.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3220 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dd7tlACU0AA5F_N.jpg"" alt=""Event Space Equipment"" width=""1200"" height=""900"" />

Co-working spaces have taken the world by storm, with brands like <a href=""//www.wework.com/"">WeWork</a>, previously NakedHub, <a href=""//www.thegaragesociety.com/"">Garage Society</a>, and others taking the opportunity to house small businesses, startups, remote workers, and freelancers in cheap, just-enough spaces that offer communal amenities and a good working environment with a certain amount of business support.

However, as long term property purchases come, rent always seeks to go higher, and what was initially a cost-effective way to run a business, has now become a cost as rent consistently rises until small teams can no longer afford the spaces. New property purchases and expansion help with costs, but the inflation rate and rising property costs always follow in its wake.

Co-working spaces already have the business support and infrastructure in place, so the move to Event Spaces made more sense as businesses of any size can justify the cost of one-time events. Meaning it's more likely to make revenue off space for events rather than tirelessly looking for tenants. Many tenants whom cannot scale as quickly as the rent does.

Spaces like Garage Society started off as co-working, but have quickly moved into a sub-brand of their own for event space only, called <a href=""//www.thegaragesociety.com/events?city=1"">Garage Commons</a>, which is a series of new properties that are only for digitized event space hosting. While one location may host the physical event, the event can be live streamed and projected to the other venues around the world to another physical audience inside those venues.

And of course, if you're planning to have a free event, then you just simply need to publicly live stream the event for all to see.
<h2 id=""franchise"">Event Space Chains, Franchises, and Networks</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3219 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/cee-cee-creative-wework-awards-dinner-9-1619x834.jpg"" alt=""Event Spaces"" width=""1619"" height=""834"" />

Recently it's becoming a trend for co-working spaces to venture into event space sales. It's sort of a natural evolution for spaces that can't rent smaller rooms for months or even years-long contracts with small businesses, freelancers and startups that have difficulty staying afloat as-is.

When it comes to events, however, any level of business finds use in event spaces both large and small, like corporate who can host something like a conference to as small as a round table luncheon. Events are also easy to expense as one-time expenses and even easier to justify the cost if the ticket price or level of engagement is juicy enough.

In this light, co-working spaces and their parent organizations have been carteling together, or privately expanding their event spaces to different cities. And sure, it's nice to be in other cities. But the real value of having event spaces across different cities and countries is the leveraging of live streaming to expand your physical audience into the digital space.

Event spaces have been transforming and reorganizing themselves to fit this model by either privately expanding as a chain with outright property purchases, like Garage Society in Hong Kong who's been slowly but surely expanding its spaces across Asia.

Others have taken the franchising route, meanwhile, other smaller event spaces without the means to expand have grouped together into a network of spaces that share a digital space, exchanging contacts and users among themselves. All of these formulas work in the same fashion, they're using limited space to expand into an unlimited one, where your reach is exposed at your whim.
<h2 id=""live"">Live Streaming: Web-based &amp; Remote Events</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3222 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Untitled-design-8-3.jpg"" alt=""Event Space Setup"" width=""1000"" height=""500"" />

Live Streaming has also taken more packaged forms provided by event spaces. Originally if you wanted to host an event, spaces would be bare bones, and you'd have to bring your own equipment to the space in order to create a live stream. You'd also need a place to host it like YouTube, or your own live streaming web pages.

These days, however, event spaces and especially those that spawned from Co-working roots, have enough business support services and equipment to stream, record, and host high quality, real-time live streamed events for the web.

As events become more exclusive, event organizers run into the issue of letting events live stream public, while still wanting to expand their audience to other geographies at once. Event spaces and their multitude of locations act as the perfect Remote Event venues. Each event space is connected to one another through their own private networks, which now gives events happening physically in one area the ability to project itself into other cities who have the same audience but still only for paying customers.
<h2 id=""partnerships"">Event Space Promotional Partnerships</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3221 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/hub-graphics.png"" alt=""Event Space Partnerships"" width=""339"" height=""320"" />

Probably the sweetest deal ever made with venues in this vein of going digital is the partnerships.

Before, an event ends, and the venue is left behind in the dust. You just move on and the venue aspect is in the rear-view mirror for your organization.

Right?

Do not make this mistake. Venues have other events at their location hundreds of times in a year. Why not tap into the vast database of contacts, experience, and know-how?

Event Spaces as well want their own ROI, just as much as you do. So approach the venue with an awesome partnership proposal. Maybe make your events exclusive to their locations? Share contacts is beneficial as well!

This not only gives you an exchange of contacts and so on, but wouldn't it make your event planning process a lot more painless if you know you have a venue that's always there to support you, maybe even with preferred or even free pricing?

Forget the digital aspect, but that venue partnership creates a long-lasting support beam for your future events, so why not take advantage of it? In this case, let the digital aspect be the icing n the cake.

3290,"10 Event Email Marketing Examples that Convert ASAP","Promoting your event takes a special mix of the physical and the digital world these days. You can't just put up some ads or posters and expect the world to rush to your doors on event day, there's a certain amount of targeting and care necessary to get the right audience to your event. Event Email Marketing is the best way as we see it.

You've got your own contacts likely, and you know them best. It's time to really leverage your list and get those contacts converting as registrants. Event Email Marketing is not much different from regular email marketing, except there is a timeline involved with a Call-To-Action that needs to give snappy, instant results like providing tickets and so on. That means your back end system is not only going to need a landing page that's relevant, but it also needs a payment processor, and ticketing management system running your event's registrants, but that's a blog for another time.

We have some great email examples here that we picked out from an amazing size called Really Good Emails, which shows some of the best emails ever made with moderators curating email submission that come in with fine-tuned precision.

Let's take a look and dig into each example, and how it can be applied for your event.

No matter the size of your event, whether it is a large conference or just a small workshop. Leverage your speakers in your email. Put their faces up front, and use it to your advantage. If you're running a much larger event, list all your main speakers and use it to show your event's clout in your industry, and if it's a small event, make sure you really leverage your main speaker's background and talents. In larger events, you won't really need to justify their presence if they're representing reputable businesses, but for smaller headcounts, you need to really leverage your speaker's personality and background to justify a reason for an email recipient to go to this event.

Even better, is because people love their face being on everything, you should negotiate with your speakers to leverage their email lists as well. This is one of the best ways to not only target your networks but also networks of people in your industry. We suggest not handing an email to your speaker as a template, as this removes control from your organization's EDM campaign. You may lose UTM codes on lines, messages, and lack open rates and other crucial data to your future's digital success.

As well, you might expect someone in your industry to be a part of multiple lists, so spreading a copy of your email around is not advised, as it might show up in one's inbox more than once, annoying them. If you're just starting off events for the first time, it'll have to take some trust-building with your partners and speakers in order to get access to that sweet, sweet list of theirs, but it'll happen, trust us. They want attendance just as much as you do.

Your event is selling tickets. That's awesome.

Focus your efforts on marketing the savings to your contact list. Everyone loves saving money. Early bird offerings are an events industry standard. By creating discounted pricing based on the amount of time ahead of the event, you'll incentivize very early registration, easily covering your overhead costs from the get-go, which is always great to report to your higher-ups, or even your venue partner if you negotiated pro-rated payment schemes or profit sharing.

But you know what else is a great way to price your Early Bird offer?

Bonuses.

You don't always have to discount your prices. You could always give away bonuses that make sense to your audience. Promise some great freebies and <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/swag-bag-ideas/"">swag bag offers</a> (or promise extra items for early bird registrants) to early bird attendees and make them feel valued. Not quite a VIP ticket, but not quite a basic attendee either, and this helps bring down the number of tickets required for you to break even.

<b>Note: </b>If your goal is to pay off the investment of the event, then going for early bird offers really brings down your margins, so do understand that if users don't latch onto this strategy, you might put yourself at risk for a low event turnout, and that's just going to hurt your ROI in the end.

<b>Tip</b>: Follow up this email with a count down to push more registrations, something like “1 week left to save!” would do just fine.

If your event is an easy to understand title that doesn't require much context to really sell what you're offering, then just go for a poster-image email.

What is a poster image email, you asked? It's a concise image or designed email that has all the main points of information of your event that can be all read without needing to scroll around to find it in a more traditional event marketing email. You just need a title of the event, a short description, date, location, a schedule that's easily read, some images, and that's about it. It's gotta be pleasing to read and eye-catching, so if you need help making one up or if you're graphically-challenged like me, there are some great tools out there like <a href=""https://www.canva.com/templates/posters/""><strong>Canva Poster Templates</strong></a> that can help you make really eye-catching posters that are meant for both social media and emails.

Just remember to make your CTA button separate from the image if you end up just posting an image in the email fields rather than building out the graphic via HTML.

The other great thing about the poster-type emails is that the image used, or a screenshot of the email's content is social media friendly and can be easily used in social media posts. Canva is also great at choosing template sizes that make your content prime for social media sharing as well.

Video content is one of the most engaging tools to leverage, not just for event email marketing, but for any level of marketing. If you have the ability to transform text and image content to video, then you really should. With the introduction of HTML5 around the web, embedding playable video content is now gaining more support across multiple different email providers, so we truly are entering a new era of event email marketing.

The great thing about events is they provide REALLY great B-roll. Something about large, engaged crowds, shows, speaker on a stage with a lapel or ear mics really just jazzes people.

So if you have recordings from past events, make your announcement or invitational event email campaign all about B-roll, testimonial, clips or speakers saying something really ear-perking, and you'll have everything you need to really push conversions. It'll get people all riled up to join the next event, and it's the best time to record your current event to make your next video even better.

<b>Tip</b>: Always always always add a link for contacts to watch the video on another host, like YouTube, as some email providers don't allow for in-email video streaming, or even corporate email networks will sometimes cut our video from emails for productivity reasons. A safe and not-so-risky solution is to take a screenshot from the video and place a “play button” over the image, giving the impression it's clickable to watch, but add a hyperlink to the image that takes them to the video on YouTube. It's the same approach, but I say you should be <strong>bolder</strong><b></b> and go for straight-up embedded video content.

Early bird pricing gives a sense of urgency already, as it incentivizes savings and/or bonuses. These are great emails to introduce count down timers. You can <a href=""//countingdownto.com/"">generate and embed a count down timer</a> easily if you can find some tools on Google, of course, free tools are tough to align with your branding, so if that's important to you, you can always pay for a decent tool to generate an embeddable count down timer for you.

Add this to your early bird, VIP, and even your basic ticketing email offers.

Want to know a great hack that works too?

Post that same count down timer on your website and social media accounts. This is one of those strategies that transcend email and can work it's magic into your other digital spaces as well.

Another great way is to make static images of the latest number of seating available if that's how you market your tickets, as “seats”. These don't need to move honestly, but it's a great way to make urgency the selling point. It's not a count down timer, but it really does the exact same job.

Note: Follow up these emails. Someone who comes back to read it again after the timer expires won't find value at all, so always follow up so that previous emails with timers get pushed further down an inbox and the latest email will be the priority read.

This one is really simple. Do you host multiple events in close time frame to each other? What if you're hosting events at the same time, but different locations? Want to save on time making emails for each event?

Just put all those bad-boys into one email. It's going to be a little cramped, but that's where the strategy of simplifying and finding the right message the fits all the events is the real solution, and it's not an impossible one. Just think holistically about the value of all your events combine, package it up, and push it out. If you can't find a creative way to make the CTA's separate from each event, then just go ahead and make a landing page for the email that gives you more room to work with, if someone already clicked to know more, they'll read the LP enough to select the event that's right for them.

I wasn't calling you stupid. That's an actual acronym used by reputable organizations like yours, and it was invented by the U.S. Navy, so you know this is big-boy stuff.

Jokes aside, sometimes, you just need to give them the message. This is a special case for contact lists where your audience is already super engaged with you. If you know they're engaged, then by all means, just give them a quick, simple little email that makes your life easier to make, and their lives easier to read. This could also be good for contacts you know that frequent events often, so a short intro of the event is probably all they need, they just need someone in front of them to tell them an event is coming up.

This is a basic design principal simply applied to an event email marketing campaign. Your brand deserves a spotlight, and having a consistent color scheme with good use of white space could be even more eye-catching than an event email with quality images and photos. It's really about the human psyche involved. What can draw their eyes to the CTA? What's the information that's most important, and have you make it easy to pick out?

Sometimes, you don't need a strategy for email campaigns. You just need to have good looking, honest-to-god emails.

Most events are for corporate. That means if you want the right audience to show up, the trip has to be justified, especially if it's on a working day. If their boss is the decision maker, and they hold the coin purse, then you gotta make it easier for your contacts to bring the case to their boss that they should attend your event.

Deliver something to your contact like a list of benefit, summaries and so on that sweeten the deal. Even better is if you have a large enough event to get transcripts and recordings of the whole event, offer than to the boss as a post-event sum-up for them to look at. As well this is also a good time to show off who is coming. Get a list of great companies from registrants already signed up, and deliver a list of these attending companies so that the contact's boss can see the networking value in this event alone. In my experience, this networking value really does the trick.

Don't make the email about the boss, you need your contact to click the email, so the general message of your email should be for the contact, but the offer needs to help sell it to the boss.

Possibly one of the most under-utilized email strategies is the post-event email thank you. Yes, you want to drive awareness of your event. There's 9 cool examples and strategies we gave you before you got to this one, so you have plenty to work with. But what you really need is to look at your strategy as more than just a way to get people in the door, it's about getting them back to that same door for the next event.

I dare say the post-email can be more crucial than the first one.

Thank your attendees for attending, and really push the value of the post-event data to them. How many people were there, who was there, and what they experienced. It's going to help them feel like they were a part of something great and it may even push them to share their experience with friends or even on social media. As well, swag bags are great to offer before the event, but digital swag is awesome too. Send them photos, videos and more that bring them more value that they can enjoy.

Another cool thing that works is setting up a way to give previous attendees discounts on their next event they book with you. It is really good at instilling loyalty with your brand.

<h2>Mix &amp; Match Event Email Marketing Strategies</h2>
I bet all these strategies and examples are awesome, and you're wondering if you could just use more than one.

By all means, I hope you end up combining these strategies in a way that is smart. Why not use Early bird pricing with a justification package for an employee's boss? Heck, you could probably find a way to combine all of these strategies into one awesome email if you've got the chops for it.

And with the way things are moving content-wise, emails are getting more and more creative each day. There's a ton of great ideas coming out, and we'll try to keep this list as up-to-date as possible.

3424,"Driving Sales & Building Communities in the Philippines with Events","EventBank hosted a panel discussion in Manila, Philippines to tackle the question 'how do you define event engagement?' on November 13th with 5 other panelists representing major brands and organizations from across the Philippines and Asia. In an opening talk about the role of event organizers and their respective organizations, Eric Schmidt, CEO of EventBank, went on to explain that events are the bridge between sales and communities.

He also went on to show that without technology, the level of support and awareness an organizer has in an event capacity, is severely limited no matter the level of engagement had at the event. Event Engagement is just as much about the lead-up to the event, <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/event-email-marketing-strategies/"">as it is the follow-up</a>.

From then on the talk transformed into a panel discussion, introducing 5 guest panelists:

<h2>The Tough Questions</h2>
<h3>How do you Define Event Engagement &amp; Successful Engagement?</h3>
Right out of the gates Eric Schmidt hits the panel with the hardest question to really answer with certainty. How does each panelist define engagement and thusly successful engagement at their respective events? With a mix of nervous sighs and nervous laughter, the audience, and panelists both anticipated some hotly debated topics brought up.

<b>Kassy</b> started off with the engagement point of Relevance, that no matter what the topic or medium at hand is if the event is relevant or not, the audience will dictate that the event was successful to you. If attendees come back in the future, if they don't leave early or leave bad feedback, or otherwise became so enthralled that they might share the event or invite others to join, then while this all can be considered engagement, the real indicator was indeed that the event a Relevant, therefore it was a success. So long as an event was Relevant, successful engagement is inevitable.

<b>Stephen</b> - Stephen jumps in with an allegory that events are “That Step before Marriage”, where the event's engagement can be summed up by how many conversions you can achieve on your end product, even if it's not the core of the event. An example he gives is that of an event he helped host for instant messaging company Viber, where indeed the attendees were there to drink and have fun, valuable feedback was given and so on. However, these engagements were engagements, but not the goal. The goal is to have users buzzing on Viber enough to purchase stickers, somewhat similar to emojis but more detailed and price driven. If tickets were not purchased in the end, then the event was a failure.

<b>RJ</b> - RJ approaches engagement with a more data-driven goal, what is the KPI of the event? Are you tracking conversions? How are you collecting data? Are you able to look through the data meaningfully and understand who attendees were, where did they come from? This data is valuable as it helps feed into your next event's pre and post-marketing. By learning from past events and your attendees, you can then use data to drive better engagement for more pliable KPIs in the future. He caps off his point by saying, go paperless and get off excel, what is the value added if you cannot use your data for more than just an email list?

<b>GiGi-</b> Gigi's approach is that the quality of the attendees is paramount to its engagement success. You could have 1000 people in a room but if they are not the right audience, then they're not going to convert or give back much value for you to use. 10 attendees in the same room where at least 1 converts are far better than the former.

<b>Luis</b> - Luis goes on to say that clients have different needs and different stages of business. In startups, people show up that's engaged, but more so on the company's success than about their product. For a startup, having a room full of people “that's engagement”. In corporate events, these have been doing more quality attendee approaches. KPIs get more specific, like the number of heads, how many people go to the booth, and who's converting?. You need to give a hard guarantee for these sponsors as a corporate. This is the real challenge with sponsors as your event grows, the dynamics of the client is different for each event, but your sponsors will get more and more strict with your KPIs.
<h3>How many of your clients say they want quantity versus quality of attendees?</h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2585 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Event-Engagement-Driving-Sales-and-Building-Communities-–-Panel-discussion-in-the-Philipplines-2.jpg"" alt=""Event management Software for the Philippines, event organizers in Manila, attendee app, CRM, all-in-one"" width=""1440"" height=""1080"" />

<b>Stephen</b> - Stephen jumped into this question head-on as his previous and first experience with Viber (see above) as well as a follow-up story. He starts off stating that it depends on the company and/or sponsor. Viber was at a stage where quality was not a priority, wherein the case of most startups, high headcounts meant engagement. But as Viber grew and encountered not only high KPIs from sponsors but also business challenges, their events now focused on higher quality attendees more than anything else.

So to answer the question, it's simply gray area. There is no way to say half of the sponsors want headcount, or half want quality attendees. This is usually up to the situation and stage of the hosting company. If anything, sponsors care only about the conversion and ROI, and sometimes they just don't care how it can be achieved in terms of KPI.
<h3>How have you taken what you learned from managing clubs into managing events?</h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2590 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Event-Engagement-Driving-Sales-and-Building-Communities-–-Panel-discussion-in-the-Philipplines-5.jpg"" alt=""Event management Software for the Philippines, event organizers in Manila, attendee app, CRM, all-in-one"" width=""1440"" height=""1080"" />

This question was directed at Stephen, who had run clubs in the past before he turned to Event industry later in his career.

<b>Stephen</b> - His main point was that the key components of running a club are the same as for events. You need good influencers and an efficient User Journey. You need to feel like you're going through an experience, and influencers are the best at helping with that. The other point is that you need to have a clear and easy user journey for your attendees and that user journey starts online.

You need to have a smooth transition from advertising, promotion, and registration to make it easy to convey and convert potential attendees. The journey doesn't stop there, it then needs to continue to the end of the event, and even beyond. As much as 40% of conversions are missed due to failure to follow up with attendees who were there long after the event had ended.
<h3>How are you marketing events (as an agency)?</h3>
<b>RJ</b> - RJ chimes in with his idea that the future of event management is through utilizing multiple channels. Furthermore, the success of ROI is first based on budgets, and second, based on objectives. Channels used include Facebook for sure, but is really just targeting the 30+-year-old range as younger Gen Z and Y audiences have flocked to Tiktok, Instagram and Snapchat. Younger generations don't use Facebook as much, as they tend to stick to using Facebook messenger, which has lead to agencies turning to chatbots instead. Instagram can be used for cross-market for a more mature millennial audience.

<b>Gigi</b> - Gigi adds onto RJ's point saying that Ad agencies are going away. Everything has a KPI, so sticking to one channel is now going the way of the dinosaurs where agencies have to be ambidextrous when it comes to marketing methods and channels. When on-site, it's important to have an Event App, not just to help go paperless, but it's a seamless way to both capture and engages attendees. An example she gives is that of China, where WeChat is everything. All contact, sing in, and engagement is now done on WeChat, so the need to market both before, after and during is now the most important strategy in the modern era of events.

<b>Luis</b> - Luis then follows up RJ's comment further stating that there is no way you can get a client with legitimate KPIs using AD agencies. Clients are using centralized ads, so you need to harmonize everything into one organic campaign.

<b>Stephen</b> - Follows up Luis saying that “The agency of the future needs to specialize in Everything”, just like in the startup world. Another point he makes that stands out is that you need to make sure you are Mobile first. Stephen also recommends video content as it's highly engaging, and bandwidth around the world is getting faster and more readily available, so much so that video can be the main source of engagement before and after events.
<h3>Can you give an example of the greatest event you've seen that ever stood out?</h3>
For this final question, a hard-pressed answer was needed as there was much disagreement from the panelists about what really was their greatest event experienced. That was until RJ piped up with an amazing example of an event that pretty much used all lessons and indicators talked about during the entire panel.

<b>RJ</b> - In Dubai and Singapore, (Overseas Filipina Workers (otherwise known as OFW) have a lot of money earned from their work abroad, but they don't know how to get the money back home. Filipino entrepreneurs came to these areas and started a series of seminars to educate these workers on how best to finance their future. First, they did a set of financial literacy events. Then, they invited them to events where they can invest in products that helped them secure more financial independence. The engagement was nearly 100%. It built a community, and now its one of the fastest ROI makers in the finance sector's event space.
<h2>Cheers and Beers</h2>

As the panel wrapped up to applause, all guests then broke off into a series of beer, food, and networks, what better way to end an event? Audience members got a chance to have some personable one-on-one time with the panelists as well as EventBank staff organizing the event.

3440,"How BritCham Singapore Reduced Member Management Costs with EventBank","This success story is a result of feedback received from the <a href=""https://www.britcham.org.sg/"">British Chamber of Commerce in Singapore</a> where EventBank won a Request for Proposal hosted by the Chamber calling for software solutions to bring together their existing isolated databases and provide a more streamlined platform for effective member management. The responses are a result of success with EventBank tackling issues with a Chamber of Commerce’s membership management system, website, and member-facing tools.

<span style=""color: #002959;""><b>BritCham Singapore Seeks New Innovations</b></span>

The British Chamber of Commerce in Singapore (BritCham Singapore) was founded in 1954 with the goal to strengthen business ties between the UK and Singapore by Building Networks, Connecting Businesses and Creating Opportunities.

BritCham Singapore’s issues with the management of data come down to 2 main problems:
<b></b>

<span style=""color: #00b832;""><b>Inneffective Membership Management</b></span>
<span style=""color: #00b832;""><b>Collaboration Roadblocks</b></span>

While BritCham Singapore is extremely effective in Singapore hosting over 80 events per year, the need for efficient data management became ever more apparent as the database of contacts grew. Among this, manual attempts to separate data lists based on certain attributes caused duplication and mis-matching of data that would ultimately confuse and frustrate staff when attempting to use them.

<img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-3581"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/britchamsingapore-website-cover.png"" alt="""" />

<span style=""color: #002959;""><b>An All-in-One Solution for a Chamber of Commerce</b></span>

The nature of the EventBank platform is that it is an ecosystem of tools and best practices that orbit one core feature, the CRM, or contact management module. This module holds the entire database of the client, and can then separate them into separate “smart lists” that can update the original contact's profile. This removes issues of multiple lists, duplicate contacts, and other similar data mismatches that one might encounter with hundreds of events happening each year.

The true value of the platform is the other tools leveraged by the chamber. This would be the Event microsite hosting, event ticketing and registration, email campaigns, and more. These are the modules that interact with members and other contacts, which means that contacts are interacting and engaging with the chamber, feeding more data into the platform. The latest data received from the contact will update old data in that contact's profile. The platform further harbors collaboration as all lists, projects, websites, emails, and events can all be collaborated on by multiple users at once, creating a space for different ideas to coalesce into valuable content and structure.

<img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-3594"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/britcham-singapore-ss1.png"" alt="""" />

<span style=""color: #002959;""><b>Immediate Results with EventBank</b></span>

By the time BritCham Singapore implemented EventBank's new website and moved their data to the EB Platform, immediate results were noticed as all team members could now collectively manage contacts in real-time. Old duplicates were merged together, and lists were compiled into one. Merge tags and smart lists were then used to separate contacts into different categories, however, all updated contact data would feed the CRM firstly, before updating the rest of the lists, removing future issues of old data confusing new data coming in. Automatic replacement of old data with the latest data has come in and has updated years of old contacts into new processes member profiles.

The new microsite, as well as main website (a separate service provided by EventBank) now, had a fully digital membership and registration sign up process that uses best practices in web form building and payments, where BritCham Singapore could effectively go paperless if they really needed to.

Among these immediate results, constant feedback from BritCham Singapore has lead EventBank to update the platform further, enhancing their experience and making their internal and external event and membership problems a thing of the past.

3717,"International Women's Day at EventBank: Empowering Growth with Diversity","<img class=""alignleft wp-image-3759 size-full"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blogpost-womensday-copy-3@2x-1.png"" alt="""" width=""2400"" height=""2714"" />It's March 8th and that means EventBank is proud to stand as one of the few companies that exemplify gender equality in the workplace this International Women's Day. In this endeavor, we continue to support women's rights and equality worldwide by working closely with women's organizations such as <b>She Loves Tech</b>, <b>Girls Who Code</b>, and <b>Women with Ambition,</b> to name a few.

These organizations have made it their mission to empower women, and entice women to start careers in STEM fields, and we at EventBank have made it our goal to support these great organizations in doing just that by exemplifying these values ourselves. With EventBank's help, they have enjoy increased engagement among their peers and their community using features that make it easier for them to support their members and women around the world.

Women at EventBank are empowered to succeed and achieve at every level, even being recognized as top women in their industry. With an above-average gender ratio of men to women at EventBank, it's clear at first glance that no glass ceiling exists for anyone who has the drive and determination in helping achieve the value we seek to provide to all our customers.

In a report by the <a href=""https://www.svb.com/women-in-technology"">Silicon Valley Bank in 2019</a>, only 56% of startups employ at least 1 woman in their leadership teams in the US, UK, China &amp; Canada, with — an abysmal — 28% of founders being women. Even in this unequal trend in gender equality in the startup world, EventBank proudly stands as one of the few startups bucking the trend, with female employees equally matching their male counterparts at every level of the company.

Though there are still strides to be made, strides have been made towards equality recently in startups. Meanwhile, a meager 5% of Fortune 500 companies have at least one female on the team. EventBank and other startups have made it a point to promote and disrupt these statistics by increasing the number of women in entrepreneurship.

<img class=""alignleft wp-image-3764 size-full"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/WechatIMG80.jpeg"" alt="""" width=""1440"" height=""960"" />

EventBank's very own Olivia Jingshu Ji &amp; Eric Schmidt founded the business together with equality in mind, and since then has been the mainstay of EventBank's employment strategy since Day 1, reaching equality among staff to this day.

EventBank's strategy has never wavered during its growth and women at EventBank have been taking on leadership roles in every department of the company, even being <a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/olivia-jingshu-ji-top-female-entrepreneur/"">recognized for their entrepreneurship </a>and ingenuity. EventBank employs 44% female staff, which is well above the industry average of <a href=""https://www.cnet.com/news/women-in-tech-the-numbers-dont-add-up/"">30%</a>.

To mark International Women's Day at EventBank, women at every level in EventBank are receiving flowers, a company dinner, and a half-day off today (or a time that suits them) as a sign of appreciation. Every day, however, is always a celebration of EventBank's female staff and the hard work they put into creating a wonderful and unique engagement platform that many women's associations and groups use to their success.

The men and women at EventBank thank you for joining us on this journey to reach true diversity and equality in everything we do.",,2019-03-08,post,http://blog.eventbank.com/international-womens-day-2019/,http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Feature-image-blogpost-2019-womens-day-Copy-2@2x-2.png|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_7138.jpg|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MicrosoftTeams-image-12.png|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MicrosoftTeams-image-11.png|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Feature-image-blogpost-2019-womens-day.png|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blogpost-womensday-copy-3.png|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Feature-image-blogpost-2019-womens-day-Copy-2@2x.png|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blogpost-womensday-copy-5@2x.png|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blogpost-womensday-copy-3@2x.png|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Feature-image-blogpost-2019-womens-day-Copy-2@2x-1.png|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blogpost-womensday-copy-3@2x-1.png|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/WechatIMG80.jpeg,"Feature-image-blogpost-2019-womens-day Copy 2@2x|IMG_7138|MicrosoftTeams-image (12)|MicrosoftTeams-image (11)|Feature-image-blogpost-2019-womens-day|blogpost-womensday copy 3|Feature-image-blogpost-2019-womens-day Copy 2@2x|blogpost-womensday copy 5@2x|blogpost-womensday copy 3@2x|Feature-image-blogpost-2019-womens-day Copy 2@2x|blogpost-womensday copy 3@2x|WechatIMG80",|||||||||||,|||||||||||,"|Olivia JingShu Ji at She Loves Tech||International Women's Day at EventBank||||||||",http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Feature-image-blogpost-2019-womens-day-Copy-2@2x-2.png,,"News &amp; Press Releases",,English,,publish,5,Eric,eric@eventbank.com,"Eric L.",Schmidt,international-womens-day-2019,,,0,0,0,open,open,2019-03-08
3775,"11 Do's & Don'ts for Elevator Pitches at Events","Pitching at events, no matter what you're pitching, is one of the most nerve-wracking things to undertake, even for an experienced salesperson. There's more to your elevator pitch than just hitting some buzzwords on the head, and it all starts with preparing yourself and understanding your audience.

As you might be aware, this is one of the most important things to any pitch. But it's more than just having a pitch ready to go. It's knowing all of the tips below plus knowing other tactics to make the most convincing pitch possible. Cater the pitch to what you're selling.
<h3>The Do's</h3>
Know what appearance you want to give off. This requires you to know your audience and the atmosphere of the event or place you are presenting at. You may want to prove you know the business world, then you should wear a suit. Using humor depends on the tone of the event.
<h3>The Don'ts</h3>
Don't just wing it. This may get you passed inexperience clients and customers but when it comes to professional investors, they can tell when someone doesn't know their stuff. Being able to answer any and all questions about your business will get you far. Surprisingly, many people don't know their own company. If you don't care about your own company, why should investors care?
<h2 id=""audience"">2. Understand Your Audience</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2289 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DSCF6693.jpg"" alt=""EventBank - Best Practices on Member Engagement, Singapore 2018"" width=""1620"" height=""1080"" />

Understanding your audience seems like a no-brainer, but it's a little more delicate than you might realize, as you'll be in that middle ground of sounding educated about the subject, and creepy because you know far too much than you should. Generally speaking before events happen you'll be privy to contact lists (depending on your sponsor or other partners) and you can use this to your advantage by researching a few samples of your audience to gauge who's coming and from what backgrounds.
<h3>The Do's</h3>
It's not enough to just know your audience, you must be able to predict how they will think of your pitch. Know their bios like the back of your hand. Check their social media accounts. Understand their personality type. Are they easily persuaded or are they the stubborn, hot-head of the group?

Tips on researching people:
<ol>
 	<li>Use Pipl, Hunter.io, and other great free tools to search people by their name, phone number, or email to find their Facebook, LinkedIn, and other profiles</li>
 	<li>Make sure to have an updated LinkedIn because they can see your profile when you look them up</li>
 	<li>Google their name to see if they wrote or are featured in news, magazine, or blog articles</li>
 	<li>Knowing their interests allows you to add something extra to make the pitch feel personal</li>
 	<li>Be mindful of your audience's priorities and preferences to cater to them. i.e. don't wear a fur coat to a PETA event.</li>
</ol>
This list is not exhaustive. It depends on who your audience is, and if you understand who they are you'll know what you need to know.
<h3>The Don'ts</h3>
Don't come off as creepy by looking up their Facebook and checking out their family, and then showing up at the event talking about their daughter's first day at school by Knowing everything about what they invest in is a good thing. Asking them about their 3 kids is weird. Don' be weird.
<h2 id=""practice"">3. Practice makes Perfect</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1124 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/networkingevent.jpeg"" alt=""practice your pitch"" width=""1050"" height=""701"" />

A cliche phrase, yet an often overlooked one. You may believe that you know everything about your company, but unless you practice, practice, practice, you may hit a roadblock when it matters most.
<h3>The Do's</h3>
<i>Perfect</i> practice makes perfect. Have the practice pitch feel as close to the real thing as possible, especially if you get nervous.

Try to use the location you will be pitching in. If you will be at a table be ready to sit or stand, but choose to stand if its an option and feels comfortable. If it will be at a networking or networking-style event, practice speaking directly to someone and avoid it sounding like a speech and more like a conversation. Remember that they will notice your body language and eye contact much easier when it's close up.

If you are on a stage, know how much space you have to walk around and practice making use of it while talking. Be ready to use a mic, headset, or your powerful voice. Holding a mic is harder than you think, so get a similar size object and spend time making sure you keep your mouth the right distance from the mic without taking your eyes off the audience. You may look crazy talking into a water bottle, but getting that $100,000 ask makes it well worth it.

Use a practice audience that is overly critical of you. This allows you to know any possible complaint or question that your actual audience may think. Some questions you may be able to answer on the spot, but be ready to answer a question you have not thought of and may not know anything about. A practice audience may bring these up, allowing you to prepare for the potentially devastating question.

Every pitch you make is practice for the next one, so you should always be improving. Some say that you should start a pitch from scratch every 5 pitches or so. This will give it a fresh feel and ensure you don't sound like a robot asking for money. Not necessary, but a good idea for people who have to make pitch after pitch.
<h3>The Don'ts</h3>
Do not use a script to practice, nor memorize your speech. A memorized speech is very noticeable and will not establish a necessary connection with your audience. This is why practicing in front of a critical audience is crucial. They may stop you mid-pitch to ask questions. They could tell you to focus on one area of the pitch rather than give the entire thing. They may not even want to hear the whole pitch. Being able to feel the audience while pitching takes a lot of practice, but mastering it will bring in great rewards.

Don't only practice the formal pitch. Use some self-awareness to know when to change minor details on the fly, because the events and your audience will never 100% be what you expect. There's no trick to this, just practice until it becomes second nature to you.
<h2 id=""connection"">4. Make an Emotional Connection</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1071 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/rawpixel-com-250087.jpg"" alt=""event pitch"" width=""1583"" height=""1080"" />

Tell a story that creates an emotional response to your pitch. Giving anecdotal evidence about why they should value will increase your chances that they will value it.
<h3>The Do's</h3>
This really hits home for me.

As a college student studying entrepreneurship and trying to start my own business. I have to take pieces of advice every day. Recently, I made my first every pitch for a company I was trying to start all on my own. Using a personal anecdote about how music changed my life, proved to the potential donors that I cared a great deal about my company and would do nothing to let it fail. This is how I ultimately sold my idea to them and got my first $100. Doing something like this will almost guarantee a heightened interest in your idea.
<h3>The Don'ts</h3>
Refrain from talking about yourself. Though the story may be an experience close to you, talking about yourself too much will make you seem arrogant and take away from why you're there: to sell your idea.

Don't just tell a story. It will waste everybody's time if you decide to talk about breaking your arm when the app is focused on the music industry. Only talk about what directly affects your idea.

Don't fabricate a sob story. This will bite you in the butt later, especially if you forget the story you told or one of the audience members ends up working close to you. Lying anywhere in a pitch is not only unethical but potentially devastating to your entire company.
<h2 id=""business"">5. Be Business Savvy</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1229 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ppppp.jpg"" alt=""How EventBank Thinks about CSR and Supports Non-Profit Organizations, CSR"" width=""1050"" height=""700"" />

While you shouldn't talk about yourself, you must give the impression you are an expert on the subject you are pitching. To do this you must know every part of what your pitching, know exactly what you want, and know the numbers.
<h3>The Do's</h3>
Your goal is to make the audience want to work with you. If you are great at your job, it means less work for them. Show a strong work ethic and dedication.
<h3>The Don'ts</h3>
Don't act like you know more than your audience. While you should know your company better than anyone else, you shouldn't be telling people they are wrong. If they make an incorrect assumption or misinterpret a statement, kindly reword what you said or give another piece of information that clears things up.

Don't make up numbers. If you <a href=""//techcrunch.com/2015/11/26/the-art-of-the-pitch/"">don't know something uses the phrases</a>: ""That’s a great question, give me a day or so to do some research and I’ll report back."" or ""I haven’t approached my research from that perspective, I’ll be sure to it — great suggestion.""
<h2 id=""elevator"">6. The Elevator Pitch</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3791 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/architecture-bright-chandelier-1281346.jpg"" alt=""elevator pitch tips"" width=""1620"" height=""1080"" />

Even though you are giving a full pitch does not mean you're off the hook for an elevator pitch. Thought the source is debated there is a common phrase, ""If you can't fit your idea on the back of a business card, you don't have a clear idea.""
<h3>The Do's</h3>
Lead strong, first impressions are everything. Giving a 10 second, 2 sentence overview of the company that hooks the audience makes the rest of the pitch worth listening to.

Follow the logline up with a longer 30-45 second elevator pitch that is also an overview of the company but gives key and compelling facts that leave the audience wanting more.

Immediately after, show the value of the company.
<h3>The Don'ts</h3>
Don't only use this when you have the chance to pitch. Any time you meet someone with potential value to your company, lean in and give them the elevator pitch.

Don't rush through this. This is the most important part of your pitch because you will lose all engagement if it doesn't make sense.

Don't use a rhetorical question, such as: Has ___ every happened to you? Very rarely do questions, not sound cliche. The pitch is all about what the idea can do and what you know about it.
<h2 id=""value"">7. Highlight the Value Proposition</h2>
A pitch is selling something to someone and the value is not always in dollar signs. A lot of value can be passed along to the person in front of you at an event if you just know exactly how to highlight what that value is.

In the business world, everyone expects that good values translate to dollar signs, and something like user growth, organic web traffic, returning users, time on page are great for software platforms and websites. Clicks and impressions are great for advertisers and so on. Other values come from tech, and what's your advantage.

Basically, what do you do that makes you stand out?

Did you come up with an answer?

That's your value proposition. Now here's how you highlight it!
<h3>The Do's</h3>
Research your competitors. Find out what makes them tick and what keeps bringing users and customers back to them. Compare it to yourself and see where you can outshine them. If you know your audience uses them at an event, then you should be ATTACKING that pain point, or their faults, or pricing, or whatever it is that makes you stand out from the crowd.
<h3>The Don'ts</h3>
Don't bad-mouth your competitors.

It's tempting to talk down about your competitors and make them seem like trash compared to you. Heck, you could even beat them in all aspects of your business and you could be very correct in your statement when attacking them.

But, when we said you should attack a pain point, that doesn't really give you an opportunity to bad mouth your competitors. Attack your audience's paint point. That's the real enemy. Taking customers from your competitor is the real insult to injury.

However, bad-mouthing competitors do no one any good. It doesn't shine any light on your product, and in the end, it just makes you look desperate and weak. You would never go to a job interview and bad-mouth the other candidates, because what then would the employer think of you? See what we mean?
<h2 id=""visuals"">8. Use Visuals</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-239 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/use-virtual-reality-at-your-event.jpg"" alt=""use virtual reality at your event"" width=""640"" height=""960"" />

There are few things more boring than sitting through a presentation that you have no interest in. Make the audience interested. Using visuals is an easy way to draw the attention of the crowd. The images or objects should carry meaning and <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/swag-bag-ideas/"">provide value to your audience</a>.
<h3>The Do's</h3>
Potential Interactive ideas:
<ol>
 	<li>Have them use their 5 senses, let them touch, look, listen, smell, or taste (if its meant to be eaten)</li>
 	<li>Have one of the audience members try it and have them describe the experience</li>
 	<li>If it can't be tested in the location of the pitch, show a video of it being used</li>
 	<li>If the product is not interactive (a process, a service, etc.) let them experience it in a different way (a band for a music service, food for a restaurant proposal, etc.)</li>
 	<li>Use Data. Show growth. Show users on your platform if that's your offer. This really sells the success you have. Screenshots even!</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Don'ts</h3>
Do not use poor quality images. No stock photos, cell phone photos, selfies, etc. This devalues what you are selling and shows you put little effort into this pitch.

Do not have meaningless images. Make sure all visuals carry some meaning. Show examples of your ideas at work. Show happy customers. Show how successful your pitch can be.

Refrain from using PowerPoints. If you can pitch without a PowerPoint, do it and make them focus on you and your pitch. If you must, use PowerPoint makes it easy to read, have just a few words per slide and be able to summarize each slide in 1-2 sentences.
<h2 id=""negotiator"">9. Be An Expert Negotiator (or a least pretend you are)</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1196 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ee.jpeg"" alt=""pitching at events"" width=""752"" height=""501"" />

Have a strategy and a plan going into the pitch. This takes, you guessed it, planning. While researching your audience, understand their negotiation strategy. Some may be impatient and not invest in people who are indecisive. Some may be willing to negotiate a lot, and some may be stubborn and not change their offer.
<h3>The Do's</h3>
Have an accurate value of the company. Have an ask that shows you value the company, but not too high that shows you are too optimistic, or just bad with numbers. Be able to stay as close to your ask as possible without coming off as egotistical or arrogant.

Have a minimum that you will accept. If the potential customers, investors, or clients are unwilling to change their offer, have a minimum value of the company and be able to say no if they will not go above it.
<h3>The Don'ts</h3>
Don't be stubborn with your number. You might have to meet in the middle between your ask and their offer, a win-win strategy. You may even have to drop all the way down to their offer if they are being stubborn. They have the power in this situation if you really want or need the offer.
<h2 id=""thick"">10. Have Thick Skin</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2136 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/green-peace.jpeg"" alt=""sustainability, sustainable event management, sustainale"" width=""1498"" height=""1001"" />

Some audience members might be hard-asses. They will put you in the hot seat and you might feel attacked. Whatever happens, think of it as constructive criticism and stick to your goal. Show them you are not a pushover and know what you want. They are being skeptical and critical because they know losing money is much worse than someone's feelings.
<h3>The Do's</h3>
Anticipate objections.

Practicing and doing pitch after pitch will get you used to the comments that once would have broken you down, discouraged you, or ruined your pitch. If you don't have thick skin now, you for sure will several pitches later.
<h3>The Don'ts</h3>
Don't be overly defensive of what your pitching. You may be wrong about something. Rather than saying “no” or “wrong,” be able to accept the criticisms and change your pitch and product for the better.

Don't be stubborn when it comes to changing your pitch. If the same question or concern keeps coming up about your company, include the answer in the presentation. If it takes more research, then take the time to do it. It's better to spend time sooner rather than later to avoid wrecked first impressions.
<h2 id=""fail"">11. Learn to Fail</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1077 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/rawpixel-com-423667-3.jpg"" alt=""pitch failure"" width=""1618"" height=""1080"" />

On top of having thick skin, the best part of an event for improving at pitches, and anything for that matter, is being able to fail. That does not mean you should strive for failure or be okay with failing. This means when you do fail — since failing is inevitable — you grow from that, and you turn the failure into a positive.
<h3>The Do's</h3>
Write down all objections, questions, or comments because your audience will think alike. Including the answers in the presentation and clarifying the pitch will prevent getting the same questions over again. Every time you do this the question will keep narrowing in on how to increase the value of the idea.

Every experience can be a learning experience if you have the right mindset.
<h3>The Don'ts</h3>
Rome wasn't built in a day. Pitching is an art that takes time to practice, fail, and perfect before finally succeeding Brian Chesky, co-founder, and CEO of Airbnb was <a href=""//medium.com/@bchesky/7-rejections-7d894cbaa084"">rejected by 7 investors</a> in Silicon Valley, 2 of which didn't even respond. Tim Westergren founded Pandora in 1999, right before the dotcom bubble burst, and was running out of money. It wasn't until Westergren's <a href=""//www.fastcompany.com/3007822/what-you-can-learn-pandoras-near-death-experience"">348th pitch</a> when Pandora received the essential funding for the now publicly traded company. In 1999, when Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin offered their website at $1 million, Excite CEO George Bell <a href=""//techcrunch.com/2010/09/29/google-excite/"">famously rejected it</a>, and again rejected it at the $750,000 price. Google seems to be doing pretty well now.

If at first, you don't succeed, try, try again. The only way to know the perfect way to pitch at events is to go out and pitch for yourself.

<em>So what's the don't here? </em>

<strong>Don't give up.</strong>

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3899 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/academy-accomplishment-celebrate-267885.jpg"" alt=""event planning degree"" width=""1620"" height=""1080"" />

Nah.

Ok, well, a degree in hospitality certainly helps, but it's never unheard of to meet event planners with degrees in other fields. Typically you can find a lot of event planners with a background in any one of these areas:
<ul>
 	<li>Marketing</li>
 	<li>Sales</li>
 	<li>Administrative Assistant</li>
 	<li>Catering/Guest Coordinator</li>
 	<li>A bunch more</li>
</ul>
Heck, you might not even <i>need</i> a degree.

It really just comes down to how organized you are as a professional. As long as you can exemplify this in your past work, resume, and so on, then use it to your advantage when seeking this type of position. If you've been involved events in the past at any capacity, try to create a “portfolio” of sorts for employers to look at. Even nonprofit and volunteer events all help your case.
<h3>Get Certified and Take Courses</h3>
Already too far into your career? No funds to go back to school for a new degree? No experience to work with?

Just go take a certification course and exam. Certificates are just as valuable as degrees these days, and getting them is cheap and takes less time than a 4-year diploma. Here are some great places to get started:
<ul>
 	<li><a href=""//www.mpiweb.org/education/certified-meeting-professional"">Certified Meeting Professional</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""//www.ileahub.com/CSEP"">Certified Special Events Professional</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""//www.nace.net/grow/cpce/"">Certified Professional in Catering and Events</a></li>
 	<li>A bunch more</li>
</ul>
If you'd like to learn more about these and a wide range of other certifications, check out<a href=""//blog.bizzabo.com/event-planning-certifications""> Bizzabo's post</a> on the topic. They go into much greater detail and show you exactly how to get started.
<h2 id=""attend"">Attend Events, Conferences, &amp; Expos</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3898 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/brittany-gaiser-426031-unsplash.jpg"" alt=""event networking"" width=""1620"" height=""1080"" />

It's a simple networking strategy. If you want to meet an event recruiter or decision maker. Go to events!

A lot of these events can be free, open to the public, and even paid ones can be affordable. Check out what events are in your area, and just start showing up. Network with the people in charge and make yourself known. We also suggest printing out business cards with your name and contact info. Clearly keep a message somewhat like “Event Planning Professional Seeking Opportunities” on the back of the card in place of a company logo, and you're golden.

These people don't have time to listen to your elevator pitch about yourself, so just drop them your card and make their lives easier, trust us, they'll remember and appreciate that you simply gave them a card with all they'll need to know on it.

Don't show up without an ounce of understanding of the event topic. If you're going to attend an event about a topic you're not familiar with, then study study study until you sound like you know what you're talking about. This is going to avoid awkward situations where you end up saying “I don't really know much about this, I'm here just to meet new people and network”. While you're honest, and honesty is a golden trait, it's not a good reflection of your organizational abilities. So Google the topic of the event until you can't Google no more.
<h2 id=""follow"">Follow Events Influencers on Social Media</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3897 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MG_3434-1024x683.jpg"" alt=""julius solaris event speaker and influencer"" width=""1024"" height=""683"" />

The best way to stay up to date on the latest and greatest trends in the event management space is to follow the ones making these trends popular. Head over to Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn, and read updates and insights that they're publishing often and regularly, it'll keep you ahead in the game and make sure you're not out of the loop.

<a href=""//www.juliussolaris.com/"">Julius Solaris</a> is the biggest name is event management, as the founder of Event Manager Blog, you'll find him posting articles, blogs, and social media posts with his insights, success, and even his failures, so you can learn from his experience in dealing with all levels of event and event marketing.

If you're looking to hire event speakers and influences, try using some agencies and aggregate collaborators to bring speakers to your events. <a href=""//www.bigspeak.com/planning-tools/all/"">BigSpeak</a> specializes in providing industry-specific influencers and public speakers to events worldwide and it's a great place to start.
<h2 id=""organized"">Be Organized and Plan Your Time Well</h2>

Well, this is a great tenant for any sort of job role. But in event management, a schedule must be kept to the minute, and all square footage of the event must be planned ahead of time from the promotional stage to even AFTER the event is over. And depending on the business model of the agency or even freelance work that you do, you could be working on multiple events in a month, where all the pre and post preparation coincide with one another.

Jump onto some free tools that help you keep track of your tasks and objectives. Trello is the biggest out there and we've found a lot of success with ClickUp so long as you can set it up in a way that matches your business and progress steps. These programs are incredibly good at helping you understand your tasks each day, week and month ahead of time. Like a CRM's deals module, you can drag and drop tasks into a progress bar that help you understand how far along in the process you've got left before a task gets completed.

It's not a tool that makes your job automated. It's basically the best form of tracking that takes some time to get used to, but once it becomes second nature, nothing will end up surprising you. They also notify you when tasks are late, upcoming, or canceled, so if you're collaborating with other team members, then you'll always be in the loop if something major goes wrong in the process.

<b>Leverage Event Management Software</b>

It's niche, we know. And it's a little daunting at first when you search this stuff on google. But trust us this is the trick that's going to transform a traditionally stressful, hair-pulling job into an amazingly stress-free cozy job.

Event Management Software helps you automate your event and contact management strategy to the nth degree. Without it, you'd end up making page after page of events manually either on WordPress or on third-party event hosting websites. The ability to recycle content is nonexistent in the Free of Charge tools out there, and to really harness your brand image, you'll have to go with a platform that's willing to give that kind of leverage up to you.

Let's talk about what goes into event management software, and the requirements you should be looking for in a provider.
<h3>Contacts</h3>
It all starts with <b>contacts</b>. If you can't manage a list of contacts, grow that list, or separate the list intelligently, you're all but dead in the water. These are core to how you manage invitations, registrations, and post-event marketing. Similar to CRMs, contact management really comes down to how well it integrates. Can it grow and evolve over time? Can you filter your contacts so you can target them with the right content?

When shopping for an event management software solution, you really need to find one that either integrates with your current CRM, and if you don't have one, then you'll need to start from scratch and find one that has contact management not only in the product but at the center of it. Like all other tools that we talk about after this point, all rely on good contact management tools.
<h3>Event Web Page Hosting</h3>
It's tempting to host your event page on something easy and free to use like Eventbrite, but in reality, you're losing a lot more than you gain with limited payment options and branding being scrubbed away in lieu of their own. It's time to really get a hang of building your own web pages that you control. If you're not a web-developer, relax, there are a plethora of tools out there that make building a web page as easy as making an email.

These pages serve an important purpose as not only do they funnel traffic into your registration form, but they also do a great job at giving your event a bit more status. Letting google traffic find your page gets them into registration faster and allows for them to click a lot less when going through pages. All content is owned by you, so, you have the power to do with it as you wish. This also lets you duplicate old event pages for easier page building for future events if you find a format that you enjoy.
<h3>Email Campaigns</h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3292 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Email-Campaigns-Ad-Copy@2x.png"" alt=""event email marketing guide"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

The platform you turn to doesn't have to have email campaign functions. But it probably should.

The reason being is that people are opening emails less and less these days. It's getting really tough to get someone to read an email that's very marketing-stylized, so that ends up to a situation we're in today where companies and organizations need to really strategize their content better and be more tactically with email targeting.

What do we mean by tactically targeting emails to your contact list? Well, it can be simple little indicators that allow you to better send emails at the right time, with the right content, to the right people. It can be as simple as understanding time zones, to as complicated as figuring out who of your contacts attended your last event.

The ideal event management software platform would be able to integrate seamlessly with an email marketing platform with this info, but that's not always the best case as a lot of data, meaning the marge tags, are not always accurate, or even it's not allowed to go into other platforms, either for technical or privacy policy reasons.

No, in reality, the ideal event management platform should already have email campaigns built into it. An internal ecosystem of integrated tools is best in this situation so that you're able to track whether or not contacts attended your last event, sign up as members, and more. You can even narrow it down to contacts who lack the right payment processing method so you can update them when your platform inevitable includes support for their processors. It doesn't seem like much, but these small indicators make it much easier to target the right content to the right person, increasing open rates and of course increasing engagement.

The more the other modules feed the CRM with contact updates, the more data-driven content you can create in your emails.

<h2>That's a wrap.</h2>
There's far more that goes into what can land you a cozy job in event organizing and planning. Lots of articles out there can help you with the EQ side of job hunting in this industry. However, in the nitty-gritty reality of event management, and indeed any industry out there, you're best off running events smarter, with tools that help you do so.

3937,"Amazon's HQ 2: Two Miracles on the Potomac (don't publish)","Since Amazon put hundreds of cities against each other in the US and Canada for a shot at moving it's second HQ to their city, political and community difference soon split opinions on the matter after Amazon selected Queens, New York City and Arlington, Virginia. Politicians both praised the decision for bringing jobs to the area, and criticized it for circumventing taxes and more at the New York location. Eventually, leading to the dissolving of the Amazon HQ2 location in New York after public backlash forced the company to back down.

Arlington, Virginia however, is a different story.&nbsp;In stark contrast to the public backlash in New York, the local community in Virginia is welcoming Amazon with open arms.
<h2>Sitting Down with Joe Haggarty</h2>
Joe Haggerty, the president and CEO of the Alexandria Chamber of Commerce, is, naturally, thrilled. Chris Mead, author of the best selling book, ""The Magicians of Main Street"", and Vice President of the Association of Chamber of Commerce Executives, had a chance to sit down with Joe and dive deep into the effects of the Amazon HQ2 move to Virginia.

Haggerty praised Stephen Moret, the former president and CEO of the Baton Rouge Area Chamber of Commerce. “He was a key factor in this whole thing,” Haggerty said. Moret, now president of the Virginia Economic Development Partnership, helped put together Virginia Tech’s longstanding desire for a northern Virginia campus with Amazon’s wish for precisely that kind of tech resource.

“They [Virginia Tech] wanted a major expansion up here,” Haggerty said. “They were waiting, they were looking for the right time, and it came.”

In addition, Moret and his economic development counterparts in Alexandria (Stephanie Landrum) and Arlington (Vic Hoskins) did much more to help make the offer package attractive. “I give them great credit,” Haggerty said. “The local jurisdictions and the state really helped a lot.” Also, the state made sure that the financial incentives would be doled out not up front but “when the jobs are here,” Haggerty said.

“They were honest,” he said of the state and local people putting the package together for Amazon. “They were not afraid to see the future.”

Transportation helped, too. The incentive package for Amazon included additional funds for the building of a new Potomac Yard Metro stop. One stop away, and a simple walk for many Amazon employees is the very busy Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.

Haggerty noted that the 25,000 Amazon employees can be absorbed in the D.C. area. After all, the entire metro area totals 6 million people. Counting only the new workers and not their families, the new people will constitute just 0.4 percent of the greater D.C.-Baltimore population. To look at it another way, the 25,000 new people – who will arrive gradually, moreover – will replace the 27,000 military workers who were moved to outlying regions after the September 11, 2001 attack on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center.

There's not a large number of people in northern Virginia who aren’t thinking about one word: growth. And who knows more about that word than a chamber executive?

“Everybody’s planning for expansion,” Haggerty said. This includes the Alexandria Chamber of Commerce itself.

“Our attendance is up on every single event,” the CEO said.

A group called Biznow recently held a meeting about the impact of Amazon and Virginia Tech, featuring speakers from both organizations. Normally Biznow’s attendance for a meeting is 200 to 250. For the Amazon-VT meeting: 1,000.

“The Virginia Tech thing is so big they [Amazon and Virginia Tech] are doing things together now,” Haggerty said.

The chamber finds that membership prospects are coming in steadily, sometimes with no known reason. Part of it has to be because of the excitement related to the arrival of Amazon and Virginia Tech. “It’s certainly put Alexandria on the map,” said the chamber’s COO and vice president of public policy, Maria Ciarrocchi.

The chamber has used the membership development firm known as Your Chamber Connection to run membership events for the past two years, gaining a total of 227 new members as a result. One wonders what the next YCC campaign will be like, with the Amazon-VT impact in the wind. Haggerty’s goal is moving from the chamber’s current 800 members to 1,000 by 2020. Given the double economic miracles in his front yard and the chamber’s embracing of growth in the community and in its own activities, he just might get there.

One of his new members, not surprisingly, is Amazon itself.

As part of the chamber’s gearing up for its brave new world, Haggerty’s board has engaged a branding company to reposition the image of the chamber, particularly as it relates to the major companies and institutions converging on Alexandria. That new branding will be ready in December.

For now, it’s still the calm before the storm. “The boom right now is going to be construction,” Haggerty said. This won’t be just for office buildings. “People are worried about affordable housing,” he said. There’s plenty to do.

“You’ve got to be looking five years down the road,” Haggerty said.

It’s a once-in-two-lifetimes opportunity. “How can you not jump on it?” he said

The footprint of Amazon's HQ2 will be so large that the economic development teams in Arlington and Alexandria came up with a new name to describe the area: “National Landing.” The spot includes the Arlington neighborhoods of Pentagon City and Crystal City plus Alexandria’s Potomac Yard.
<h2>About The Location</h2>
Alexandria, Va., is across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., and across a small creek, Four Mile Run, that separates the picturesque city from another one, Arlington. In turn, Arlington, home of the Arlington National Cemetery, will be the new eastern headquarters location of Amazon. Over the next dozen years, 25,000 mostly high-tech workers, with an average salary of $150,000, will stream into the buildings that Amazon is preparing first in Arlington, and possibly later in north Alexandria as well.

The cherry on top of Amazon’s arrival, or more accurately, another gallon of ice cream, is a $1 billion investment for a 1 million-square-foot northern Virginia campus of Virginia Tech, the state’s flagship tech university. This campus, in the Potomac Yard area of north Alexandria, will graduate 750 students each year with degrees at the master’s level or higher.

Then you can throw in the three Georges: Georgetown University, George Washington University, and George Mason University. Toss in one of the leading community colleges in the nation (Northern Virginia Community College, with a mere 77,000 students hailing from 180 countries), plus the University of Maryland, Howard University, the University of the District of Columbia, Johns Hopkins, the University of Virginia (with a branch of its business school in Arlington), and others, and it’s a signal for the likely birth of the capital of technology on the U.S. East Coast.

3992,"Success Story: How IACC Karnataka Transformed Membership with EventBank","This success story is a result of feedback received from the <a href=""https://www.iaccindia.com/"">Indo-American Chamber of Commerce Karnataka</a> .

The IACC Karnataka came to EventBank at a point where they were looking for a system to help them manage their numerous events. They wanted to <b>engage better with the attendees</b> in order to expand their network and grow their membership.

IACC Karnataka wanted a system in place which could automate their membership process and give a better experience to their members who have decided to associate with them and are from big corporate organizations. A long-lasting relationships with members and non-members and in return generating revenue eventually lead to a shift to EventBank.

<b>IACC Karnataka Seeks New Event Solutions</b>
In holding many events each month, as more chambers of commerce do, the IACC Karnataka approached EventBank with the issue of poor engagement with attendees, seeking to automate this pain point, and leveraging more digital features to expand their network and grow attendee numbers in future events.

Majority of attendees at IACC Karnataka events are representing large corporations and organizations in India and even from around the world. With this level of attendee quality, an improved level of user experience was the expressive core value that the IACC was seeing in the hunt for a new solution.

<img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-4679"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/iacc-membership-copy@2x.png"" alt="""" />

<b>The Solution: An All-in-One Event Management Platform</b>

In response to these requirements, EventBank was quick to approach the problem with its Event Management platform, wherein all necessary back-end and user-facing features are integrated together into an all-in-one platform that helps to automate event management. The platform is a combination of best tools in the event industry like CRM, Event web page creation, email marketing, ticketing &amp; registration, and much more.

The EventBank platform starts at the contact level with its built-in CRM, which is the center of all its integrations. All updates to contact details from the other modules feed the CRM, and automatically update contacts as they respond to emails &amp; events from IACC's EventBank account. The constant updating of contact info with real-time data keeps everything up to date, allowing for smarter engagement in the future. For instance, the IACC can now see who in their contact list attended a previous event in a series so that they could email their previous attendees who may possibly be more inclined to attend again.

The event page module is a combination of best practices in digital web page design specifically for events, by keeping templates easy to understand and deploy. This is not the value, however. The real value comes from the ability to take content from event pages and re-purpose and recycle them in other content. For instance, if IACC Karnataka wants to create an event invitational email in the email campaign module, the platform will generate an invite email will all the blanks filled in with the selected event's details and content. This includes images, text, and colors so that an invite email only takes minutes to send to attendees without having to be manually created.

<b>Relaxed event list maintanence</b>

Since implementing EventBank into their membership and event management process, IACC Karnataka staff report lists being more useful than they were in their previous processes, easing staff stress over event promotion. A recent event run with the EventBank mobile QR code check-in method went smoothly, and up to 6 members were renewed via automated renewal reminders being sent by the EventBank platform to members who were running close to the end of their membership terms.

Chambers like the IACC Karnataka often find themselves in dire need of upgrades due to the aging and tiring methods of manual contact list updating, membership management and more. With EventBank, IACC can now not only track and management member, but it can also leverage automation to make its recurring revenue more attainable without needing to manually reach out to each member to renew their membership. This also creates smarter lists for IACC Karnataka as it can now track user actions both on the website and at events, which makes it easier to target members and contacts based on their actions.

This is a common tactic that event organizers use to get attendees from past events to show up to future events and build a highly engaged audience and membership for any organization.

4882,"The Ultimate Guide to VR for Events","<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Providing <a href=""//get.eventbank.com"">event management software</a> to clients around the globe, we've seen events leverage some incredibly amazing new tech. Innovative new ways to market and engage audiences have been wild, to say the least, and one of the biggest moves in events as of late has been Virtual Reality (VR). Ever since the release of the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive, VR has taken the gaming world by storm. It wasn’t long until more practical applications were released, and filled up booth after booth of conferences the world over. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We had the awesome chance to sit down with </span><a href=""//shadowfactory.io""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Shadow Factory</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, a rising star in the VR developer community, to help us understand and compile some neat instances of VR that’s really disrupting how an event engages the audience and create this wonderful guide to VR for Events. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Using VR or AR at an event puts you at an advantage because consumers are already excited about immersive technology,” says Amit Chatterjee, partner, and co-founder of Shadow Factory – a leading developer of digital content and solutions in Hong Kong, Toronto, and Los Angeles that produces fully immersive and interactive experiences. “Not only are you likely to attract more foot traffic to your booth or pop-up, but immersive experiences also achieve higher retention and brand recall.”</span>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What’s VR?</span></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4964 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/people-2557494_1920.jpg"" alt=""vr in events"" width=""1620"" height=""1080"" />

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before we go down the rabbit hole of VR at events, we thought we should help flesh out what VR actually is so that everything else we dive into makes a lot more sense. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Virtual reality is focused on the idea that the user should be fully immersed in a digital environment. The first and most obvious of the 5 senses to be immersed in order for this to be considered “VR” is sight, and so you’ll need a set of goggles that are specially designed to block out the real world and only show the digital one via bifocal-lense screens inside the device. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While this is the bare minimum to be considered VR, a pair of controllers, or in some cases, hand-motion capture nodes set around the room and on the headset, should be used so that the user can also interact with objects in the digital space. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Optional I/O like Headphones, Microphones, and even treadmills allow the user to listen, communicate and even walk in the digital world, though, these do not hamper the “VR”ness of your experience if you forgo these items.</span>

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4966 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/VigilantMeanGibbon-size_restricted.gif"" alt=""vr treadmill"" width=""419"" height=""252"" />

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now that that’s over.</span>
<h2>Crafting the Experience</h2>
[caption id=""attachment_4965"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""706""]<a href=""//www.virtualrealityhire.com/""><img class=""wp-image-4965 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/samsungvrevent.jpg"" alt=""VR conference"" width=""706"" height=""258"" /></a> <span style=""color: #999999;"">Image by Blue HIre</span>[/caption]

The most crucial thing to understand about VR at events, and even VR in general, is that it's all about the experience. This is a new technology that allows for true interaction and captures the user's senses in a world only you could think up.

Before you go shoving VR in everyone's face, it all comes back to marketing principles. What's the user journey of your VR experience?

Crafting that journey, that story, comes down to your product or service, and how well you can capture your audience's engagement. The story, however, shouldn't just be a ride. If what you imagine is to be a passive demonstration of what you do, the user would be just as engaged as if you had shown them a video.

Interactivity is equally important as the story told. User agency is the prime differentiating factor in engaging someone at your booth. By giving the user the ability to have the freedom to move and explore, or even have the ability to make choices, the experience has now elevated their engagement, and it gives them a much more impactful takeaway from your booth.

Here are some neat ways that you'll find VR being used in events near you.
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Virtual Demos</span></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Virtual demos are by far the #1 way to enhance any event that has a product or location as its focus. Not only that, but it expressively shows designs of future products without requiring the audience to suspend its disbelief. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are some neato burrito real-life examples to sink your teeth into.</span>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Auto Industry</span></h3>
[caption id=""attachment_4967"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""819""]<a href=""//www.ford.com/""><img class=""wp-image-4967 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/0_lyZvuVI0puO78R5q_.gif"" alt=""VR auto show"" width=""819"" height=""422"" /></a> <span style=""color: #999999;"">Image from Ford Motor Company</span>[/caption]

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the auto industry, there’s been a lot of adoption early on for VR to help give showroom floor demos of new car designs and models not yet released, in order to drive early buzz for the new vehicles. These demos, of course, are brought over to events and expos the world over, and it’s a great way to create a cost-effective booth experience.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Normally, an auto manufacturer would have to cast out a model of the new design, concept carbon fiber versions of the body (usually sat on a previous model’s chassis) and then expensively shipped the world over to auto expos so attendees can walk around and experience the new concept. With the induction of VR into an event booth, that same concept can be developed virtually, and the much less expensive VR headsets and accompanying gear can be shipped or even rented at the event space, so that booth visitors can try on the new snazzy goggles and experience the same thing the cast-model of the car would provide. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And sure, it lacks the ability to touch and feel the concept itself, but when it comes to the attendee experience, the idea that they could be using VR to experience viewing a new model, while a lot of them have never experienced VR before, will be thrilled to be trying one of the most cutting edge technologies, and that experience will stick with them for a good long while.</span>

The experience is more than just a showroom tour, where normally an audience would see the model from afar in the audience seating area, now they'll be up close and personal with the new model. They'll be able to use VR handsets to interact with the car, open its door, even sit and take the darn thing on a virtual test drive.
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Architecture &amp; Interior Design</span></h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4970 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MultiuserMeetinginVR.gifmultiusermeetinginvr.gif"" alt=""VR Architecture"" width=""480"" height=""480"" />

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In real estate, architecture and design, showroom booths are extremely expensive at booths. The main attraction for a designer both the architect and the interior, are dependent on the booth to show off their values, typically transforming an entire booth to look like living room for instance for an interior designer. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Rather than expensively and painstakingly transforming and building out this bedroom set, just hand over a VR goggle to your attendee and let them experience the room in virtual. Just like auto industry booths, the attendee can walk around and experience the intended design work.</span>

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4969 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/images.jpg"" alt=""VR interior design"" width=""309"" height=""163"" />

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A 3D concept of the building in a virtual setting includes the surrounding area as well (ideally), and instantly it’s clear how the building not only looks but also how it looks relative to the surrounding already-existing buildings, giving much better aesthetic to future of the project. All this while local city planning committees are globally becoming more conscious of the aesthetics of a building project to its surrounding area.</span>

This is also an ideal way to combine both the interior and architectural designs of a project. Scale models on a table do little to impact a visitor on the grandness of the building. By allowing users in VR to scale their own perspective and see the project from the ground level, the project becomes very real to the user.
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Training &amp; Simulations</span></h3>
[caption id=""attachment_4968"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""882""]<a href=""//www.ford.com/""><img class=""wp-image-4968 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/FordGravitySketch.gif"" alt=""VR training"" width=""882"" height=""460"" /></a> <span style=""color: #999999;"">Image By Ford Motor Company</span>[/caption]

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This one is quite obvious. Training simulations, mostly for auto, aero, and rail training, have traditionally used virtual reality since its inception. But unlike commercial VR like we have today, airlines and rail couriers often train their pilots using large, moving platform simulators in which the operator is encased in a similar environment as the vehicle they’re intended to operate. But this is largely expensive, and, not very modular. If a new series of airplane releases and the cockpit is largely different from the simulation, suddenly the simulation is less effective.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s costly to update these platform-style virtual simulations, so, the next best alternative is VR goggles. It lacks replica control panels and moving platforms, but when it comes to immersing one in a virtual and interactive environment for training purposes, a $1000 HTC Vive and $4 million moving flight simulator tends to be an easy choice. It doesn't replace the effectiveness of platform-style VR training environment, but it's a great stand-in when budgets are tight.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And what’s the neato-ist part? They can bring it anywhere. To new locations to train a new regional headcount, or to pilot schools to entice new pilots to join the airline, something it so desperately needs. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Or...<a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/event-spaces-going-digital/"">an event space</a>? ;)</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Health and medicine is another great area of a more humanitarian use case of VR. Physicians are always looking for more cost-effective ways to train students, show surgical incisions to patients, and so on. VR allows for students to explore the human body layer by layer with full anatomy in view. It's a great way to orient a student with the human body's anatomy and hones surgical skills.</span>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Education</span></h3>
[caption id=""attachment_4971"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1280""]<img class=""wp-image-4971 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/maxresdefault.jpg"" alt=""VR classroom"" width=""1280"" height=""720"" /> <span style=""color: #999999;"">Image by Tablet Academy</span>[/caption]

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Education is another area of events that really strives to introduce tech into classrooms across the world. EduTech is a rapidly growing industry and VR is set to take over. With a younger population of students becoming more tech savvy each year, early adoption of VR in childhood education is not only a great idea, but it’s likely going to become one of the new learning mediums used in more affluent schools. Oculus Rift even has its own</span><a href=""//www.oculus.com/blog/announcing-oculus-education-pilot-programs-in-taiwan-japan-and-seattle/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> education pilot program</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> providing Oculus Rifts to schools, libraries, and museums in Tokyo, Taipei, and Seattle. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The introduction of smart boards, tablets, and other tech gadgets have been a growing demand for schools across the US, and more are hopping on board with corporate education initiatives each year. So much so that event’s like EdTech Europe &amp; EdTech Asia have been at the forefront of showcasing new technologies specifically for the classroom. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This, of course, garners a great way for VR to make its way into booths on the event floor. Showcasing of educational games started the trend, and eventually, interest grew on the developer’s side of things to create specific tools for teachers like </span><a href=""//vrmath.co/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">VRMath</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Defense</span></h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4962 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/us-military.jpg"" alt=""VR military "" width=""800"" height=""521"" />

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Law Enforcement &amp; Defence are one of the earliest adopters of VR. In the earlier days, VR has been massively expensive, and early tech improvements from Japan in the ’90s failed many quality and security measures that allow the US military to adopt training tech. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This has changed drastically since then, and now defense forces around the world are quickly adopting VR into their advanced training for specialized missions, jobs, and tasks. Paratroopers are using VR to familiarize themselves with parachutes by immersing themselves into a 3D virtual environment. Again, aircraft VR training is now commonplace in all the branches of the military, and of course, combat simulations using pre-existing combat simulations on computers, but now this time with VR headset integration.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This means it also extends into police training where officers are put into virtual encounters where decision making and fast reflexes are put to the test in suspect pat downs, pursuits, and more. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You might be asking yourself, how many events could these possibly be at? While not all that public, events around the world for defense and law enforcement expos account for Billions in contracts made on show floors. And of course, VR simulation developers are showcasing their new programs to militaries and private defense contractors the world over. Just like in entertainment, military customers are also easily drawn to event booths with ultra futuristic VR headsets donning the heads of curious visitors.</span>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Engaging an Audience</span></h2>
[caption id=""attachment_4972"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""808""]<img class=""wp-image-4972 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/download.gif"" alt=""VR engagement "" width=""808"" height=""484"" /> Image by BrandBa.se[/caption]

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">VR is an incredibly immersive experience that captures a user’s fullest attention, making it one of the best ways to impact your audience at any event. The equipment is easy to source, however crafting experiences for your visitors at the booth begins long before the event takes place. Take a look at your product, your service or your message, and try to picture that in a VR environment. What can you do with it to captivate the user and get them completely enthralled in what you do?</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Introducing VR into your event starts months prior. It needs to be a long term plan in place as developers need to envision your goal and create it, a time taking ordeal. This means the user journey starts from the inception of the idea, until the delivery of the program to the VR sets at the event booth.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The appeal isn’t just from appearances either, virtual tours and demos are a great way to engage each visitor and have them experience your products or services without bringing costly(er) equipment. </span>

<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Virtual Venue Tours</span></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4973 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/E2-DUBAI-SOUTH-LAUNCHED-VR-VENUE-EXPERIENCE-1600x1000.gif"" alt=""VR Tour"" width=""1600"" height=""1000"" />

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is more for the event organizers themselves, but venue shopping is one of the most costly steps in the preliminary process of getting an event up and running. Typically venues need to be physically visited at the location so that proper analysis can happen. Where are the visitors going, what’s the floorplan, and so on. If the venue is a flop, then organizational staff just wasted time, and of course, time means money when the clock is ticking down an event. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is where VR really does step in. By using 360-degree images and some development know-how, a venue could recreate a photo-realistic virtual reality version of their venue. What’s even better is that VR users can interact with other remote users, so, essentially staff at the venue can interact with event organizers by touring the venue with them.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That means you might start seeing VR Goggles on the desk of event organizers in the future. In fact, this leads into the next awesome way VR is impacting events.</span>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Virtual Events</span></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4974 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/preview.jpg"" alt=""VR remote meeting"" width=""590"" height=""332"" />

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Virtual Events are still a bit niche, but it’s a great way to include remote visitors in an event space, without letting them feel left out as if it was recorded on screen. This also goes both ways with speakers and audience members for the type of events with this format.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The usage of 360 video cameras is getting more mainstream, and with that, live-streaming 360-degree video of an event is not a plausible option for VR headset owners to engage with. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How? </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Set up a pole in the middle of the audience’s area, with a 360-degree camera, and stream it online. Lag and stream delays are expected but of course, that’s fine as long as the audio and video sync. At this point, users from their homes can throw on a pair of VR goggles and now suddenly they’re thrust into their favorite concert. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This goes the other way, as those same setups can allow speakers to virtually speak at events. This is an odd maneuver that’s questionably engaging. It’s a neat trick, but a lot of audience members refer to this as a little “uncanny” for their tastes. </span>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What does this mean for you? </span></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Everyone used to think home PCs were for the rich only because of the price, and soon after everyone thought that flat screen TVs were for the ultra rich because of the price. Now it’s all affordable. Don’t think it’s so unrealistic for your home to have it’s own VR goggles that the family uses day-to-day within the next few years. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Rather than just watching the super bowl, you might be virtually experiencing it first hand. Of course, this is completely opposite to what super bowl Sunday is all about, but you get my point. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Attending events is going to change its meaning over time with VR products lining shelves. It’ll be no longer a question of whether you were there or not, but rather if you had time to slap on a pair of goggles and take part. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Realistically, however, VR is more likely to continue being a showboating effort at events, and that’s OK! The mere fact that VR attracts visitors to a booth at events for years to come, really just stands to make more of an impact on potential customers around the world, who in turn would consider purchasing VR, increasing overall consumption and demand for the new tech, which then pushes developers to make more engaging and useful programs. </span>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How does one get VR on the event floor?</span></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Collecting the necessary parts is easy. In fact, it’s easy to set up your booth. All forms of VR gear can be easily accessible and affordable. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What’s really the hard part is developing a VR simulation, demo, or game that works for your business or goal. This requires a full-scale vision of your goal and it has to start long before your next event. This means knowing what you want virtually and approaching VR developers to help you develop it. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What’s more, is you’ll need adequate space. Each VR hardware manufacturer has their own set of specifications for a “playable” area, but generally, it’ll need to be </span><b>1.5m x 2m (5 x 6.5 feet) </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and should be unobstructed</span><b>.</b>

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4975 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/vr_space-1011x576.png"" alt=""Vr room setup"" width=""1011"" height=""576"" />

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The other caveat to this is that you’ll need likely a desktop PC system that would be able to run VR programs, which does take a bit of horsepower, and if you don’t have the recommended specs already, here’s what you should look for when looking for a machine to run the VR sims:</span>

The whole setup could be thousands of dollars, but depending on the expo or conference you’re at, this could be a drop in the bucket compared to the square footage you purchased for the booth. However, if you are indeed hurting for money, then renting or hiring a VR events team for the occasion may just help. There are even event venues out there that support VR by providing the gear directly for an added cost, so keep an eye out!</span>

5297,"25 Unique Recruitment Event Ideas to Find the Best Grads","Move over millennials, Gen Z is the next generation to graduate. And with this new graduating class, comes the need to recruit them. The college industry is <a href=""//www.forbes.com/sites/lucielapovsky/2018/02/06/the-changing-business-model-for-colleges-and-universities/"">beginning to change</a>, the rising cost of higher education, the abundance of online classes, and the heightened substitute-ability of colleges give businesses and colleges a greater difficulty in drawing in the best talent for open positions<i>. </i>Companies are finding unique and fun ways of identifying candidates for their openings. So we cobbled together 25 unique campus recruitment event ideas that are sure to attract not just the best students, but also the best companies to the floor.

One of the best ways to win over college students is playing a game to win free rewards. These various competitions will help you decide who is the best candidate for a certain job, while they are seeing how fun working at your company can be.
<h3>1. Pitch Event Competition</h3>
Allow students to give 1-minute elevator pitches to sell their idea, company, or anything you throw at them. You can even throw a curve ball and see who can best pitch themselves. Teach them <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/event-pitching-dos-donts/"">the best tactics</a> for selling their ideas.
<h3>2. Startup Engine</h3>
Give students 2 hours, 24 hours, a week, or any amount of time to come up with an idea for a company. Give them the chance to design a business plan, MVP, pitch, or anything that can sell a company, and have them present it to a team of judges. Watch out for students with the ability to lead, follow, or work under pressure.
<h3>3. Consulting Competiton</h3>
Call it an innovation challenge, a case competition, or something fun, but this is a classic competition put on by the large consulting firms. Give students between 4 hours and 3 months to research a problem and come up with a solution. Make sure to give them enough freedom so you can see solutions evolve to questions you can't even answer.

Example: <a href=""//accentureinnovationchallenge.com/"">Accenture Innovation Challenge</a>
<h3>4. Business Plan Competition</h3>
A more formal competition: this will allow students to prove to you they know how to work through every aspect of running a business. Look for new possible investments, amazing talent, or the next big company.

Example: <a href=""//ventureacademy.mckinsey.com/"">McKinsey Venture Academy</a>
<h3>5. Hack-a-Thon</h3>
A hack-a-thon is the perfect tech-based competition that can incentivize your recruitment event and company. This event will identify the best of the best as they prove their exquisite computer programming, science, or engineering background. Awarding winners with offers to your company will ensure the strong potential of your business.

Examples:<a href=""//us.money2020.com/companies/paypal""> PayPal's Money2020 Hackathon</a>, <a href=""//hackathon.nba.com/"">NBA Hackathon</a>

If you'd like to register competitors and potential recruits, consider using an event management software. Book a demo to see how it all works.
<div>[contact-form-7 id=""3235"" title=""freebies english""]</div>
<h2 id=""fun"">Sponsor Some Fun</h2>
Instead of a full-blown recruitment event, attaching your name to something may be enough to put your company's name in the head of recruits. This is a cheaper way to connect with students without compromising your image.
<h3>6. Concerts</h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5300 size-full"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/artists-audience-band-1763075.jpg"" alt=""music concert for recruitment events"" width=""1512"" height=""1080"" />

Almost every medium to large college will have at least one concert that draws a large crowd. Give the student body a little extra dough so they can host someone everybody knows. Putting your name on an event outside of the career fair will lock that name in their brains as somewhere they want to work, especially if it attached to their favorite artist. Working with the student union may also help you find students who already know how to do the role you are looking to fill.
<h3>7. Puppies</h3>
Shelters love to bring their animals to campus to show students that they need their help. Sponsor an event that connects your business with cute dogs. It's also a great way to loosen up these often times stressed and nervous grads so that they can speak with more confidence and relaxation with recruiters.
<h3>8. Meditation and Yoga</h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5302 size-full"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/backlit-beach-dawn-588561.jpg"" alt=""recruitment relaxing methods"" width=""1620"" height=""1080"" />

Teach healthy habits with mindfulness by <i>forcing </i>students to take a break from their stress-educing lives. University can be hard and letting them take a break from their work by killing two birds with one stone will draw in the best and the brightest. Recruit and refresh.
<h3>9. Sports</h3>
Not everyone is going to be skilled at sports so choosing something relativity easy will make it fun for everyone. Prove to these youngsters that your company is not full of boring robots in an office. Have fun with the recruits and let them enjoy some downtime with some friendly sports.
<h2 id=""workshops"">Workshops</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5303 size-full"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/board-2449726_1920.jpg"" alt=""recruitment event ideas workshop"" width=""1619"" height=""1080"" />

Hosting workshops will show potential recruits that you are here to help them improve just as much as they are going to help you. Find those who are willing and ready to learn and sort out those too cocky to ask for help.
<h3>10. Interviewing Workshops</h3>
Behavioral interviews are the easiest to prepare for, but the easiest to slip up on. Case and technical take a ton of practice and require someone to work with. Come to campuses and show students how it's done while giving them the chance to test their skills on actual interviewers.
<h3>11. Mock consulting cases</h3>
Rather than a challenge, watch undergrads lead and follow as a team to formulate a solution to a problem you give them. Guide them along the way so they know if they are heading in a good direction but let them slip up along the way. Then, have them present in front of the company like they would as a real employee.
<h3>12. Externships</h3>
Don't fear, less commitment is here. Give them a chance to test the internship by only hosting them for a week or weekend. Watch them get their hands on a project and see what they can do under pressure. Sometimes the brightest candidates are the dullest employees.
<h3>13. Resume Workshops</h3>
Resumes and CVs are oftentimes either poorly put together when it comes to fresh graduates. Or they're too nervous about their lack of work experience so they stuff it full of needless info. Resume workshops are a great way to teach those who thought they learned it all already by the time they graduated. It gets them on the right track to writing what you as the employer want to see in a resume, and it gives them a healthier chance of landing that job with another employer should they not get picked up by you.
<h2 id=""charities"">Philanthropic Events</h2>
Members of newer generations find improving the world for the better as a key trait for their life. Prove to them that your company loves helping people, cleaning the world, or raising money for organizations that need it by recruiting through philanthropy. <a href=""//fortune.com/2016/06/22/fortune-500-most-charitable-companies/"">Many Fortune 500 Companies</a> focus on one or two ways to help the world and choosing something specific will help choose an event to start.

Gilead Sciences works to eradicate HIV/AIDS and liver disease, Walmart helps the anti-hunger charity Feeding America, and JPMorgan Chase has a “service corps” of employees that assist Detroit nonprofits in developing strategic plans, financial models for earned revenue, and improved human resources systems. All of these companies can work to include potential recruits in some way to better their company and their philanthropic endeavors.
<h3>14. Foodbank</h3>
Collect cans from students that they don't know what to do with at the end of the semester or have potential recruits provide a helping hand at local food banks. Both will point out students with a mindset that includes values outside of a salary.
<h3><a href=""//www.habitat.org/"">15. Habitat for Humanity</a></h3>
Look for students who are wanting to spend a Saturday building houses rather than attend a darty (day-party). They are the ones who want to see the world improve and are willing to help.
<h3>16. Run for _____</h3>
<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-5304"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/runner-888016_1920.jpg"" alt=""runner race gravel"" />

Host a 5k, 10k, or half-marathon to find recruits who care about their body and whatever organization you are raising money for. Join some students on the run and find out why they are running. You will learn a lot about students as neither of you can wait to cross the finish line.
<h2 id=""mentoring"">Mentoring</h2>
Connect several students each with an employee so they can get help from someone in their potential field of work. Let them ask what classes they should take, what extracurricular are meaningful, how to write a resume, how to network, and so on. Spending 30 minutes each week will create a lifelong expert worker.
<h3>17. Speed Networking</h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5305 size-full"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/agreement-2548138_1920.jpg"" alt=""recruitment event ideas"" width=""1619"" height=""1080"" />

Bring several employees to campus to help recruit by talking with many students for 5/10/15 minutes. Determine who can spend their time wisely while learning about the max number of students in a short amount of time.
<h3>18. Questions &amp; Answer Sessions</h3>
Let them ask a few questions so they can learn if the company is right for them.
<h3>19. Resume Review</h3>
Do fast resume reviews to show the students that they have limited time to make an impression with a piece of paper.
<h3>20. Interviews</h3>
Do a mock interview to ask the essential questions and give feedback on good or bad responses.
<h2 id=""food"">Free Food!</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5306 size-full"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/background-2277_1920.jpg"" alt=""free food at recruitment events"" width=""1620"" height=""1080"" />
<h3>21. Coffee</h3>
A great way to bridge the gap between a college student who never sleeps and someone who works around the clock. Free coffee will attract students to attend your events by making it worth-it to escape their “books” and grab a much-needed energy boost.
<h3>22. Berries</h3>
Gen Z'ers are just like millennials when it comes to nutrition. Finding good fruit on campus may be difficult for secluded campuses. Bribing students with vitamins will attract students who care about their body and will care about your company.
<h3>23. Just Desserts</h3>
Let's get the students out of bed and trick them into grabbing a treat while having a worth-while conversation to find the perfect candidate.
<h3>24. Grill some Dogs</h3>
Show students you care and have a great community by grilling hot dogs for students who never stop eating. Ketchup, Mustard, and Recruiting anyone? Relish this connection.
<h3>25. Luncheons &amp; Follow-up dinners</h3>
Now for the perfect candidates, take them out to dinner. They will say yes to their out-of-budget restaurant allowing them to brag to their friends. This gives you 2-hours to have a positive connection with the few students you need on your team.
<h2>Are 25 Campus Recruitment Event Ideas Enough?</h2>
Probably not.

Campus recruitment is a combination of professionalism and casual fun. It has to show graduates the future that lies ahead of them, that it's fruitful, endeavorous, and it has to be attractive. It's part marketing, it's part recruitment, and it's part strategy, and 25 ideas aren't nearly enough to scratch the surface. Recruitment events can often time revolve around one industry and in many cases, these ideas will need to be adjusted to encompass this. Use your imagination, and see what your competition is doing as well. Spy on their tables and adapt or adopt their strategies if you see it's working as well.

Planning your own recruitment event is essential to connecting with the best and brightest of recruits. In-person connections will always beat the job board websites that are seemingly taking over this field.

5321,"Success Story: How FKCCI Doubled Member Growth with EventBank","This success story is a result of feedback and data retrieved from the <a href=""https://www.fkcci.org/"">Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry (FKCCI)</a>.

Seeking to expand their membership network, automate their management &amp; engagement, and introduce integrated email marketing tools to their staff, FKCCI selected EventBank as their solution of choice. It's been one year since EventBank has been providing solutions and support to FKCCI and there's been some interesting feedback and data that's been collected since then.
<h2>One Year with EventBank</h2>
After one tremendous year with EventBank, FKCCI has had some incredible leaps in the growth of its membership network, ease of management, and promotional success. Here are some great takeaways:

<b>Membership Growth Doubled</b> - 2 months after board and governance elections at FKCCI, full use of the EventBank platform began as part of an ongoing campaign by the new leadership to increase membership and expand its network. According to FKCCI, before signing with EventBank, it's membership growth was around 300 members over the course of a year. After leveraging EventBank's all-in-one solution and combining the best of CRM, Marketing and Event Management practices, FKCCI more than doubled their growth and added on 700 new members since signing on.

<b><img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-5358"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/fkcci-copy.png"" alt="""" />Online Applications Gone Digital</b> – The FKCCI website was integrated with EventBank's web widgets, event pages, and other tools. FKCCI now reports 5 applications every week and membership staff receives form-filled applications and scanned documents online making it more sustainable for the organization, and easier to follow up digitally. This again has helped the increase in membership.

<b>Online Registered User Engagement</b> – FKCCI also reports to have close to 300 non-members who are have created EventBank accounts and registered so that they can be engaged with FKCCI. This is a new medium of engagement for FKCCI and they expect this number will grow into the next year.

<b>Email Campaigns </b>– It's been easy for FKCCI to send out targeted event invites, notifications and regular campaigns to both members and non-members. They make it a note that the smart lists are a great feature in helping segment their audience in order to target the content to the right people. The most important benefit is the ability to automatically generate an event invitation email campaign from prior data in FKCCI's event web pages. This means they can now create invitation emails in mere seconds. In regular marketing email campaigns, they can also drag and drop event details from the tool with pre-populated event info as well.

<b>Automated Renewals Reminders</b> – Finance tracking has been much easier now that EventBank automatic renewal notices get sent out to all members. This also means payment can be done through the payment gateway which will help their finance team by making it so simple that a mere export reports an entire business cycle for FKCCI. The payment gateway also leaves more avenues for purchasing options in the future should FKCCI opt to expand their payment options for members and event registrations.
<h2>Complete Success</h2>
After opting for EventBank and transforming their business to become more digital, FKCCI has effectively increased their membership rate by more than half, adopted new engagement techniques, leveraged best-in-class marketing tools, and automated their renewal process. It's with these incredible gains that FKCCI has achieved that has led them to renew their contract with EventBank in 2019.

FKCCI President Shri Sudhakar S Shetty reports that the increase in membership registrations is in part due to the E-mail campaigns and that digital registration forms are being easily accessed online.

<b>About FKCCI</b>
Founded on May 8th, 1916, the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry has had a distinguished array of businessmen and industrialists at the helm of FKCCI, establishing it as an apex organization for Industry, Trade &amp; Service sectors in Karnataka.

5395,"7 Steps to Crafting Your Ideal Membership Welcome Package","Membership strategies are as much about the follow-up as they are with the lead-in, and with more and more organizations going digital with membership management. We decided this would be a great chance to come with some welcome package offers that engage and satisfy your new members. By doing so you increase the chances of expanding your membership through referrals, and exciting members to enough to renew their memberships later.

<h2 id=""top"">Organizations are going digital</h2>
By leveraging <a href=""//get.eventbank.com/membership-management-software"">membership management software</a> membership-based organizations like associations, chambers, and clubs can now take all of their traditional methods of membership registration, on-boarding, and engagement to a cloud platform that's easy and simple to use. This helps save on the time-cost of dealing with physical paperwork and manual actions like email promotions, event management, and membership renewal notifications.

It's with this new tech that organizations can now offer more benefits, and that also includes introducing some digital goodies to their usual welcome packages. We've got some great ideas to welcome your new members, check it out!
<h2 id=""email"">Welcome Email</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3293 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Email-Campaigns-Ad-white@2x.png"" alt=""membership welcome package"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Welcome Emails are a must-have and a no-brainer. Registration processes are the absolute first item on the menu that gets digitized, and it helps feed your list of contacts, in this case, members. Once you have their email and name, it's the perfect time to immediately shoot them an email.

What should be in this email? Absolutely everything they need!

Your welcome email should make your members feel welcome of course, but it should also act as a jumping-off point for members to know what their membership entails in a summary, and offer resources that get them started. It should also point them in a direction they might be interested in.

For instance, a cricket club just got a new member, and he's received the welcome email automatically. The ideal welcome emails should be welcoming, and then provides directly the resources he needs to get started or links to the sources online. This could be instructions on how to rent equipment, schedule of events or open field time, cost of uniforms and clothing, and so on. Among that there should also be a way to push members to be active from the get-go. In this case of a cricket club, it would be an offer for new players to attend a training session, which instantly gets new members engaged.

Depending on the formality of an organization, the welcome letter might come physically as a sign of quality gratitude, but this still doesn't remove the necessity of digital email deliveries, as it's a great way to keep track of user engagement. A physical letter can be lost, but an email can be found for the foreseeable future.
<h2 id=""cards"">Membership Cards</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5403 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-2.png"" alt=""virtual membership card"" width=""600"" height=""600"" />

Membership cards hold a special place in everyone's hearts. It gives the feeling to a member that they hold the key to something important, and it makes them feel exclusive. This should be the second, but equally important function of any welcome package.

Membership cards are not just a symbol of exclusivity either. They're also a functional engagement tool that helps members unlock access to areas of facilities, gain discounts, check in at events, and more.

Depending on the scale, or size of membership markets in an organization, supplying physical cards can be a costly endeavor, and wouldn't you believe it, they're going digital too! How? Membership management software like here at EventBank, are developing membership cards within smartphone apps that function as a physical card does. This means it can be used to check into events, get discounts, scan and more.
<h2 id=""gifts"">Gifts, coupons, and other swag</h2>

Of course, who doesn't like a free gift? It's one of the easiest ways to immediately satisfy a new member and helps to make them feel valued. Gifts can come both physically and digitally too. The most common digital gifts are simply discount codes, or a certain amount of discounts or rebate applied to the member's account with the organizations.

These gifts could arrive in the welcome packet, or at a later time. You can also set up membership goals that let periodic gifts get delivered to members who achieve certain criteria, or just to entice them to stay a member longer. We believe criteria goals are better than time goals as a great technique to use if member turnover is high in an organization. Criteria goals encourage participation and engagement which is the key to reducing turnover. Gyms are a great example of this, where members who complete a certain routine at the gym can earn gifts like vouchers, water bottles, and more. Whereas professional organizations would reward members who attend events often with items relevant to the industry or cause.

Of course, if the items are physical, make sure they follow 2 great criteria: They're <b>permanent</b> <i>and</i> <b>branded</b>. Don't brand paper cups to give out if they're just going to end up in the trash, and don't give out steel thermoses if they're not branded. For most members, small trinkets give temporary satisfaction, so branding needs to carry on in order to provide long term recognizable impact and helps to spread your organization's name around. Like in our <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/swag-bag-ideas/"">Swag Bag article</a>, we talk about how items can help improve the user experience by adding QR codes that give awesome benefits back.
<h2 id=""guest"">Guest Passes</h2>
Guest passes are quite an easy giveaway, and it's quite a great way to leverage your current members into becoming spokespersons bringing new prospect members to your organization's events and facilities. Delivering these guest passes can be both physical or digital, and there can always be a structure of how the guest passes work.

For example, you could limit guest passes to:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Single-Use</strong>: A single guest pass for access to Events, or one-day access to facilities.</li>
 	<li><strong>Monthly Usage</strong>: A member can bring a guest to 1 event or enter facilities once per week/month.</li>
 	<li><strong>Unlimited Use</strong>: Guests can access events and facilities so long as they are with the member who invited them.</li>
</ul>
These strategies are great because it helps encourage new and fresh faces to enjoy your organization's events, services, or facilities, and is very likely a high converting part of any organization's strategy.

<h2>New Member Discounts</h2>
<img class=""wp-image-5406 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/add-on-woocommerce-member-discounts-771x386.png"" alt=""Membership Discount"" width=""771"" height=""386"" />

New members are pretty curious about your offers once they join, and prices could be the barrier that keeps them from fully engaging from Day-1 of their onboarding as a member. It's a phenomenal idea to offer new member discounts that last enough time to make them consider purchasing other items or services you offer. This is also a great chance to leverage new member discounts into partnerships with other third party businesses so that you can provide further value outside your organization's walls.

Typically new member discounts should last 1-3 months, and the discounts should be in-line with your strategy. Discounts can also come with free trials of other services, like renting sports gear for instance or offering 1 free meal. This could also be considered as part of the freebies given away in the first email delivery as we said earlier.

The strategy is all about providing early on offers with as little barrier as possible. A member who enjoys meals at your facilities might love your food. But if a new member might potentially stay as a member for this meals, but is not given a discount in their onboarding as a new member, they may actually skip this offering since they just spent money on a membership. These discounts offer less of a cost barrier that gets members engaged early on, and lets them explore enough about their new membership that makes them latch on and stay a member even longer.
<h2 id=""events"">New Member Events &amp; Tours</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3219 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/cee-cee-creative-wework-awards-dinner-9-1619x834.jpg"" alt=""Event Spaces"" width=""1619"" height=""834"" />

It's an easy gesture and it goes a long way to help new members feel welcome. Throw a monthly event just for new members so they don't feel overwhelmed with your normal events which, at times, can be quite overwhelming if your organization has a lot of moving parts.

For instance, if you run an organization about a certain programming language and you want to encourage new coders to join, a welcome event is a great way to introduce them to your organization's methodologies, events they can expect, and some training.

If your organization is centered around a physical location like a sports club or gym, then maybe there's a need for a tour around the campus. Think of it like orientation. This can make them feel welcome, but more importantly, it gets them up to speed and ready to jump into more intricate activities in your organization's near future.
<h2 id=""referral"">Referral Program</h2>
Tying this in with the Guest passes, you can incentivize your members to bring in others to check out the organization's events. By creating referral programs, you enhance the effectiveness and the longevity of members by offering perks, more gifts, discounts, or premium access to members who can sign up a referral that they bring.

This is a very, very common tactic that seems to work in most cases. Great setups like getting a discount for both the current and the new member will encourage the current member to stay longer and refer more future members, and the new member will feel extra special that they got a discount or reward of some kind.

Here are some cool referral program strategies to consider putting into your program.
<ul>
 	<li><b>X% off for You &amp; Your Referral</b> or <b>Receive this awesome gift for referring a new member!</b></li>
 	<li><b>X% off on your next membership renewal.</b></li>
 	<li><b>Refer X amount of new members and get this amazing gift/discount!</b></li>
</ul>
There's plenty of other creative ways to craft a referral program, but most of all, it's important to know which one reaches out to your members.

<strong>P.S.</strong> you can stretch these programs out to include rewards after a certain period of time if the referral member renews. So, for instance, if someone brought in a referral to become a member, and a year later they renew, you can go back and reward the original member who introduced them. It's a great way to make the referral program strategy into a long term one.
<h2>Over to You</h2>
It's incredibly lucrative to leverage welcome packages into a long term engagement strategy that keeps member renewing their memberships and bringing in new, fresh faces to your organization. What we have here is a compiled list of great ideas to use. You can use one, or two, or all of them, as they're all meant to give back early value and satisfaction that can help your organization grow.

There's more to managing your members than just giving them a warm welcome. They crave engagement, and one of the best ways is to keep them in the loop on your organization's events, activities, and news. What better way than to give your organization a mobile app that keeps your member up to date on real-time communication, promotion, and events with the EventBank App. <b><a href=""//get.eventbank.com/membership-management-software"">Book a Demo</a></b> and we'll show you how you can turn your organization into the digital space and give your members the engagement they crave.

5427,"Looking for a Wild Apricot Alternative?","EventBank was built on the frustrations felt by chambers, associations, and other member-based organizations who know the headache that it takes to build up engaged members that stay for the long term.

<h2>Elegant Website Solutions for the Modern Era</h2>
Wild Apricot offers free website design and implementation, but to make this cost-effective for it's abundant free and low-cost customers, their web-design value comes from the usage of cookie-cutter templates.

5434,"Success Story: How AWA Ran 11 Events in 8 Days with EventBank","This success story is a result of feedback received from the <a href=""https://www.awa.org.hk/"">American Women's Association of Hong Kong</a> where a solution was needed to help manage, promote, and process ticket transactions for 11 separate events in an 8-day schedule. The responses are a result of success with EventBank tackling multiple events in a short span of time, automated payment processing, and easy contact list management and email campaigns.
<h2>11 Events. 8 days.</h2>
The American Women's Association of Hong Kong (AWA) planned to host 11 events over the course of 8 days. The entire campaign would consist of panel discussions, talks, and workshops focused on empowering women who are looking to go back to work, change careers or start a business in Hong Kong.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5739 size-full"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/AWAWISE2019-WEWORK3.jpg"" alt=""AWA women's support"" width=""1620"" height=""1080"" />

<a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/international-womens-day-2019/"">Read more</a> <span style=""color: #999999;"">on EventBank's Women's Day mission with AWA and other women's associations.</span>
<div>The issues faced with running these back to back events was the necessity to promote, ticket, and process payments for each individual event under the umbrella of the <a href=""https://www.awa.org.hk/activities/local-activities/awa-wise/"">AWA WISE</a> campaign, so all the various workshops, talks, and panels had to be listed individually as well as part of a series so users could sign up for one or more events simultaneously.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The key for AWA was to be able to process all payments - which, up until AWA WISE AWA was processing for their internal events, person by person, manually. The capacity for these events was 800+ tickets, which would have put immense pressure on the non-profit to be able to efficiently manage.</div>
In search of a solution, AWA attended an event by EventBank and the American Chamber of Commerce Hong Kong, about <a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/event-engagement-driving-sales-and-building-communities-panel-discussion-in-hong-kong-photos/"">Driving Sales and Building Communities</a> where they learned about the EventBank Event Management Platform.

What AWA President Andrea Roth found compelling was ""the idea that through EventBank's integrated system, our team of volunteers - sometimes in different parts of the world and time zones, could effectively plan, manage, and deliver a large scale series of events at a professional level, which is one of our priorities.""

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5740 size-full"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/AWAWISE2019-WEWORK2.jpg"" alt=""AWA Events"" width=""1620"" height=""1080"" />

<h2>The Results</h2>
The platform indeed combines all events under one roof by allowing AWA to host all of the program info, splitting separate and ticketable events apart, so that users may register for one, some, or all of the included events and activities during AWA WISE. The platform also allows for AWA to process registration payments automatically, and without the need to manually process any tickets.

Initially, many early participants bought one ticket but after the first event they attended signed up for more in the series with their sign in details already registered, they reported it was easy for them to add more events to their schedules.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5745 size-full"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/AWAWISE2019-Deloitte.jpg"" alt=""AWA Wise with EventBank"" width=""1440"" height=""1080"" />

Among these initial pain points being solved, AWA reportedly enjoyed the email campaign module of the EventBank platform as it had easily allowed for massive campaigns to all attendees and contacts, and most importantly, it allowed for targeted email campaigns to attendees by utilizing merge tags that personalize each email sent to contacts.

</div>
<blockquote>""Great customer service. Our EventBank team was on hand every step during the initial stages as we built the program on the platform - and whenever there were issues was there to walk through solutions with us immediately. When onboarding new technology or using platforms, especially when unfamiliar, the human element is so key to user ease. Our team found this an incredibly useful tool."" -<strong> Andrea Roth, President, American Women's Association of Hong Kong</strong></blockquote>
</div>
Customer success teams are core to EventBank being able to deliver events at every level to any organization. AWA found the EB team to be accessible any time they were called upon: through set-up, problem-solving, and guidance throughout.

Throughout the run-up to the program, AWA had promoted, ticketed, and checked in hundreds of attendees, and in doing so was able to leverage the EventBank CRM to it's fullest capacity. By tracking every registration, email click, check-in, and more, AWA's contact list on the platform had been updated. Now, if the organizers so choose, event-specific emails could be sent directly to attendees who attended particular events and more.
<div>EventBank's detailed CRM allowed AWA to see real-time data on participants - ""in those anxious months before a large-scale event, it was important for us to be able to see if our marketing campaigns were effectively reaching our soon-to-be attendees. In Hong Kong, where committing to events is so last minute, this gave us reassuring data"" Roth adds.</div>

While EventBank's platform is not replacing the customized, embedded platform AWA uses at the moment, it was a necessary solution to the issue of scale for AWA. ""In hindsight, we know now we could never have done the AWA WISE series of events how we are set up currently, and EB has certainly set the bar high for how we can manage events of this size and nature in the future. It was a crucial solution to a rapid-fire event program with multiple events, hundreds of attendees, all within a short amount of time"", concluded Andrea.

5457,"9 Critical Features Every Membership Management System Needs","Membership management systems play a major key role in Associations, chambers or commerce and other membership-based organizations. But it's difficult to find one that brings the right features to the table. There's more demand than ever for new features, integration requests, and other technical requirements so lets pin-points what the ideal membership management software might have under the hood.
<h2 id=""top"">Identifying your needs and pain points</h2>
<a href=""#list"">I know my pain points, get me to the list of features!</a>

As an organization or business that relies on memberships to thrive, it can be tough to choose a membership management system for you that:
<ul>
 	<li>Registers members</li>
 	<li>Manages members and contacts lists</li>
 	<li>Automates renewal reminders</li>
 	<li>Promotes news, updates or events</li>
 	<li>Processes payments</li>
 	<li>Creates customizable forms</li>
 	<li>Integrates with other tools</li>
</ul>
And it gets even more difficult when one membership management system lacks even one of these features. That means you'll need to find a solution that not only helps with your requirements but now it also needs <i>integrate</i> with the rest of your tools.

And how are companies integrating these days?

Like <i>this</i>.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5460 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/zapier.png"" alt=""Membership management software integration"" width=""502"" height=""210"" />
And <i>this.</i>

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5459 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Capture.png"" alt=""Membership Management software problems"" width=""292"" height=""264"" />

You'll find it's become more commonplace among software solutions out there, any solution, either charging you extra for integrations or locking them behind paywalls and more expensive packages. Hubspot lists nearly 300 apps on its integration marketing place, but<b> only 28 are free</b>. Leaving the rest of the integrations in much more expensive package levels.

Now you not only have to pay for both platforms but now you'll have to pay just to integrate them as well.

But don't worry. A new trend is coming to fruition that surprisingly started within the membership management tech community, and that's all-in-one membership management systems.

What do these do?

Well, it's a collection of all the necessary tools and features an organization would want in a singular platform. All the tools are natively integrated with each other at no extra cost, which is the key money saver. The value, however, is how well these tools communicate and share data between themselves that no third party integration could ever truly do.

So, to make it easier for you to understand what these tools and features are when they're put into one of these all-in-one platforms, we made this list of 9 critical feature your membership management system needs to be successful, and most importantly, free of nickel &amp; diming third-party integrations.

CRM's are typically the bare minimum when it comes to taking organizations digital. Also colloquially spoken as member databases, member lists and so on, CRMs are the industry catch-all term for the ability to manage contacts and keep their information up to date in as simple a manner as possible. This goes without saying that if you find a membership management solution that does not have this feature, then it should be avoided.

Without a proper member CRM, you could not personalize, customize, or automate any engagement activities you take with contacts. Furthermore, you'll find it difficult to build your lists if you use other tools that engage contacts that are separated from the CRM. If they are not integrated, you simply cannot add contacts to the list automatically. You'll find the process very manual, and you might as well go back to using spreadsheets.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1525 size-medium"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/crm@2x-300x288.png"" alt=""CRM, event ROI"" width=""300"" height=""288"" />

The all-in-one platform approach solves this issue by just simply having it at the core of the system. All modules you'll find down this list will at some level feed information and contacts to the CRM as well as take data from it to personalize and/or automate that module's role.

This feature comes first in this list, and you'll probably see it creep it's way into the functions of the rest of our features as well. CRMs are just that important.
<h2 id=""mobile"">Mobile Apps</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-687 size-medium"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/evnt-1-215x300.png"" alt=""Attendee engagement"" width=""215"" height=""300"" />

Mobile apps are one big bottleneck for a lot of platforms. When it comes to membership-based organizations, engagement is the #1 defining role the management needs to take on. Technology persists at every level of people's lives nowadays, and that typically comes in the form of a smartphone in the pockets of every one of your members. This is where it's crucial to introduce your organization's own app so that members can stay engaged on the go.

While most membership management software providers do provide some form of mobile app solution as part of their platform, it often-times becomes an add-on or additional cost. Usually, because it's either a headache for them to implement cleanly as a reflection of the client's website, or just simply building it from scratch as a service.

This is the biggest feature gap that a solution can have, so when you're shopping for a provider, make sure that mobile apps are included. Sometimes you can find platforms are mobile-friendly, but that leaves a lot left over to be desired for members. An App is a huge step up in engagement quality than a mobile-friendly platform, as it gives the organization complete control over the visibility, information, and notifications that get delivered to members.

Furthermore, there are features on mobile apps that don't work on a desktop format like a web app does. The next feature shows a really great example of a mobile-only feature.
<h2 id=""card"">Digital Membership Cards <img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5466 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-2.png"" alt=""Virtual Membership Cards"" width=""600"" height=""600"" /></h2>
Digital membership cards are a great way to leverage mobile apps to your organization's, or even the planet's benefit. Digital membership cards function exactly like most physical membership cards do, but exist on your organization's mobile app.

Physical membership cards act as a form of identification and a key of sorts. It's common that membership cards unlock doors to facilities for members only, check in members at events, and even used as a way to confirm discounts for members on certain purchases.

Digital membership cards can do all these things by leveraging a smart phone's myriad of sensors, GPS, camera, and so on, the digital card becomes far more actionable, customizable, and of course more green, as there's no longer need to print wasteful plastics anymore. Digital cards are delivered and redacted digitally and instantly, making it far more seamless to manage memberships.

Activities that the member uses via their digital membership cards feed into the CRM of the platform. Every check-in, ticket purchase and so on get recorded in their history, or updates their contact details automatically, and accordingly. This makes your membership list a living, breathing source of accurate data.
<h2 id=""community"">Community &amp; Member Directory</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-854 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ww-1.png"" alt=""membership directory"" width=""391"" height=""445"" />

Another great feature that doesn't have to live on mobile apps, but instead both, are membership directories and communities for organizations. This basically allows your members to 'log in' to your website or mobile and use widgets from the platform on the website that gives members access to a database of members. Though, in best practice, it's best to formulate communities which are basically separating your database into particular subjects that might appeal to certain sects of your membership or audience.

This lets members network digitally and remotely and fosters a sense of connectedness in your organization. This is arguably one of the least required features, but it's an easy enough one that we feel it should be a part of any platform, and removing the ability for members to log in is just one more degree of separation from an organization that member might be wanting.
<h2 id=""email"">Email Campaigns</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3293 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Email-Campaigns-Ad-white@2x.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Email campaigns are a big feature. One that is also plagued by third party nickel and diming schemes, so if it's not already a part of an all-in-one platform, then it's best to continue shopping around. Member engagement comes in a lot of forms, but it's with an email campaign strategy that direct messaging and marketing can be pivotal.

Members want to be kept in the loop, and emails are the most direct way to do so (aside from pushing notifications on your mobile app), The greatest aspect of email campaigns is that they can automate and personalize each email for members based on the CRM, which is ideally the very same CRM we talked about at the beginning, where all contact data is kept up to date simply by the member's activities being tracked by each module.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5467 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/edm-merge-tags-1.png"" alt=""Email Customization Merge Tags "" width=""600"" height=""543"" />

Merge tags are a great way to personalize each email to the contact by leveraging their details in the CRM. A tag written like this, ""[firstname]"" without quotes, will be replaced in the live email with the sender's actual first name, and only for that sender. It does this by tracking down the destination email address in the CRM and replacing the tag with the correct tagged detail. This works for any pre-existing data.

Personalized emails mean blasting emails to contacts doesn't require making them generalized or bland to catch all contacts, and each email will seem like it was written for each person directly. This is a great way to engage and delight your contacts.
<h2 id=""automation"">Automated Membership Reminders</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5484 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/EventBank-Membership-flow.png"" alt="""" width=""1369"" height=""739"" />

Automated membership reminders are simply a base requirement for any membership-based organization. If you're looking for membership management systems that help you kick your feet up while growing your member-base and ROI, then you're going to need automated membership reminders. How these reminders are delivered are up to the platform, but generally, emails and push notifications are the standard methods.

When members get close to the end of their membership, it's important that the membership management system you adopt actually knows when this is and notifies the member of their upcoming membership termination. Without this automation, members will be blind to their membership's end date. Most people don't memorize the end date of their memberships, so it's quite easy to slip into a situation where members are unaware of memberships ending and then constant confusion and explaining the situation to those who rightfully get frustrated at this moment.

It's best to nip this situation in the bud and just remind members to renew their memberships. This brings you to ROI faster and keeps your membership numbers higher. No manual intervention, just let the system take over.
<h2 id=""event"">Event Management</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-628 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Check-Ins.jpg"" alt=""Event Registration Tips"" width=""984"" height=""406"" />

Events are a huge part of engagement in a membership organization. Without events, members would be hard-pressed to actually meet and mingle together. Depending on the role that your organization plays in your community or industry, it's important to host events as it's a great way to get members involved, draw in new members, and establish yourself as an important figure in your industry or community.

Events, if you haven't already guessed it, are leveraging tech now. Probably more than ever before.

QR code check-ins, live streaming, and <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/event-vr-guide/"">even VR have been injected into events</a> in the past few decades, but the most common denominator is the need to go paperless at the door. Your very same mobile app could be adopted by attendees and each account would have a QR code. That means scanning the QR code at the door, checking in the registered guest, and then that information is tracked on the CRM.

Now, for future events, you can make certain email campaigns for members who had attended events in the past by creating a smart list. See how these tools come full circle?
<h2 id=""payment"">Payment Processing<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5469 size-medium"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/manage-anywhere-en-380x190.png"" alt=""membership payments"" width=""380"" height=""190"" /></h2>
Payment processing is important for those organizations who transact often for tickets and membership fees. If it's not part of a membership management system, then it's probably not for you. Payments online are commonplace now, and manually tackling this ordeal only makes engagement and ROI goals harder to reach.

Without payment gateways, members are stuck manually paying, and you'll be stuck manually processing. It's time-consuming, and if you should ever expect to grow your organization meaningfully, it's only smart to give your members the ability to purchase digitally and process the payment with a gateway. It brings up the quality of the membership experience and puts the payments in the palm of member's hands, which makes them feel more in control.

This also opens up more opportunities for converting new members by giving multiple methods of payments, accepting differing credit card companies, and so on. Now, you may wonder why you can't just do this separately from the platform. Well, you could. By why not just have it included? This reduces the need to hard-integrate this function on your website, and it comes ready-to-go with the platform you choose from Day 1.

On top of that, you'd need to integrate each payment gateway one-by-one. By using a platform for this, the integrations come pre-installed, essentially.
<h2 id=""analytics"">Full-Scale Analytics</h2>
<img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-5486"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Product-Screens-CRM-profile-ver-1@2x.png"" alt="""" />

Analytics are likely the easiest module for a membership management system. Any good SaaS model out there offers some level of analytics, and it's important to know that the membership management system you choose to go with does indeed include this feature. It's highly unlikely that it's missing, but if you come across a product that lacks this feature, treat it as a red flag.

The key component of analytics is not only taking in web traffic, and event traffic, but how you're able to combine this data and make sense of it. There's online user actions and offline member actions. Knowing the member journey from entering your website to becoming a member, to checking in to events is a great way to not just benchmark yourself as an organization, but pin-point your most valuable members for promotions, rewards, and keep your loyal members engaged.

Analytics are also key in identifying bottlenecks in your organization so that you can take action and can address what makes users drop off the membership sign up process, or skip renewals.
<h2>Membership Management Systems are an Engine</h2>
A well-oiled engine runs smoothly and the same goes for membership management. Every module an ideal membership management system has is crucial, and they must work together in order to create an automated, but personalize engagement solution that keeps turnover low, and grows your membership.

It needs to be digital, and easy to understand, but most importantly it needs to bridge whatever gap there may be between the organization and the member. When choosing a membership management system, it relies heavily on looking inward toward your organization first. Knowing and pinpointing your needs and pain points are key in helping you choose the right solution for you.

At EventBank we've taken all these modules we've talked about above, and more, and combined them into an all-in-one platform that eases most pain points for organizations. There are some great benefits that aren't just features on the platform when you leverage EventBank, as you'll get dedicated customer success managers whose sole goal is to help your organization succeed.

5760,"Data-Driven Marketing & Events: A Panel Discussion","On April 16th, EventBank and Pico Group co-organized a panel discussion on the topic of <a href=""//www.eventbank.com/event/data-driven-marketing-events-12815/"">Data-Driven Marketing &amp; Events</a> so that we can dive deeper into the most hotly contested topic to date, data and how companies use it.

<hr />

The night kicked off with networking over wine and hors d'oeuvres and quickly settled in for the discussion. At the offset, EventBank started with a quick presentation to get the audience thinking about what event marketing data truly means to them, in hopes that through the following panel they would come to conclusions or even solutions that pertain to them.

Two major challenges, EventBank says, are a hurdle for many event planners. How do we automate data collection? And, how do we combine the online &amp; offline data that we just collected?

EventBank is a software platform that aims to help manage and market events, bringing the value of an <a href=""//get.eventbank.com"">all-in-one package</a> that combines the necessary tools to get the job done.

All tools like event web page designing, email marketing, ticketing and registration, QR code scan check-ins and more revolve around the platform's CRM module. This lets all the tools you use to constantly and automatically update your contact and attendee lists, as well as letting the features take this updated information so that it can personalize and automate your tasks. As well, this collects physical attendee actions like check-ins to help bridge that gap between online and offline data and helping to create a viable attendee journey.

Here's the live stream.

Soon after, panel MC Anson Bailey of KPMG kicked off the discussion by  introducing the panelists:

<strong>Anson Bailey (MC) - </strong>Anson joined KPMG in Hong Kong in 1999 and is currently a Partner based in the Hong Kong office heading up the Consumer &amp; Retail Practice in the ASPAC region. He is part of the KPMG Global Consumer &amp; Retail Steering Group as well as being a member of the Global Technology Innovation Centre and the Cluster Leader for the Technology, Media &amp; Telecoms Practice based in Hong Kong.<strong>
</strong>

<strong>Greg Crandall -</strong> After 15 years of Silicon Valley specializing in content and event services for Apple, IBM, Motorola, Silicon Graphics, Adobe Systems, and Disney, Greg Crandall re-joined the Pico Group to spearhead Pico +, the global total brand activation company. Here he is responsible for using technology to build omnichannel and through-the-line channel experiences for global brands.

<strong>Edith Wong - </strong>Edith Wong is Chief Marketing Officer at Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK), a government department tasked to attract, facilitate and retain foreign direct investment into Hong Kong. The department works with companies of all sizes, from startups and SMEs to multinationals, and supports them in every stage from planning, setting up to promotion and expansion.

<strong>Ravindra Ngo -</strong> Ravindra has 10+ Years of experience in senior management working for multinationals and start-ups. He has Founded and acts as President of the Cambodian Association of Hong Kong, he reinforced his network with Consul general, diplomats, and governmental institutions in China and with ASEAN countries in line with the Belt &amp; Road Initiative (BRI) and Greater Bay Area (Guangdong, Hong-Kong, Macau).

After the formalities and introductions, the discussion was quickly pointed towards one of the biggest topics of the past few years.
<h3><img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-5770"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Data-driven-events-marketing-hk-16042019-9-e1555491700160.jpg"" alt="""" /></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Who owns the data?</h3>
<strong>Edith</strong> - Edith starts off the by saying that people say data is now our currency. I think this is absolutely true. Data is a bartering system these days. The key issue, however, is consent. Governments and people alike are now more concerned more than ever that proper consent is being given for the exchange of goods and services for their data and privacy.

<strong>Anson</strong> - Anson chimes into Edith's comments by saying that the Americans are a bit slow on this. There are a lot of American tech companies like Google and Facebook who are in a lot of hot water with their use of the people's data. And, they could very potentially be penalized if governments took a hard-line as they're doing in Europe with the new GDPR.

<strong>Greg</strong> - Greg soon took the mic to say that 'we've lost the war'. He thinks that the data now belongs to the companies now, and that's what's happening or is going to happen is that people are going to fight back. Every time we use an app that's critical to our lives like a map on our phones, we tend not to read long and drawn out policies and terms, and we end up giving up our information without much sense of the consequences of doing so. So now it's time to fight back.

<strong>Ravindra</strong> - As a business association, Ravindra says, this topic is quite sensitive. Organizations like Marriot Hotels and Cathay Pacific have had data stolen. Just like this, associations like the British Chamber of Commerce, or the American Chamber of Commerce are reporting that their networks are increasingly concerned about hackers. No matter how responsible an organization is, that data is always up for grabs.
<h3><img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-5774"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Data-driven-events-marketing-hk-16042019-17-1.jpg"" alt="""" /></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3>What role does digital play in marketing?</h3>
<strong>Edith</strong> - What EventBank does with their platform is taking the data that matters and then creating a journey for the attendee. That story that's created is core to how an event should be run. Challenges are faced often times without the right data, and that only serves to make it harder for organizations like Invest Hong Kong to grow.
<h3>Are we already using tech to track behaviors at events?</h3>
<strong>Greg</strong> - We're already doing this. We're already tracking every little thing. But it comes back to the issues we talked about earlier. We've already lost the data war, and now we have to earn that data back. Technologies like keypads, camera facial recognition, QR code scanning and more, allows us to collect data that personalize the user experience. I'll add though, to this, is that it's a bit freaky to us. Greg also adds that while this situation of complete data-driven personalization is freaky to use in this older generation, this personalization may be completely acceptable by Gen Z, Y, and Millenials.

The discussion soon turned into a free-for-all where audience members chipped in with their ideas about the generational gap. Discovering very surprisingly that the younger generations are actually far more distrustful of brands than previously realized.
<h3>What's the next technology?</h3>
<strong>Edith</strong>- The value of technology is as good as the data. The value comes from avoiding bad data, as much as it is about collecting good data. How do we know the journey we've created is valid? Are we duplicating information? It's difficult to see what next evolutions come from technology, and it's difficult to see into the future in the next 10 or 5 years from now what that will be.

<strong>Ravindra</strong> - I've seen and been involved with a lot of technologies, like AI, and so on, the evolutions can be seen much better when we look across borders. Between Asia and Europe, adoption of payment systems has gone digital in China versus even Hong Kong. Hong Kong as made its advancements of course, but China is a market that's fully adopted transitional technology. We can look across borders to see what's next.

<strong>Anson</strong> - In China we see there's this leap-frogging. I've done a lot of consumer reports in China, and in the last few years, you start to see cash-on-delivery as the primary form of payments. Then a few years later there are debit and credit cards coming up. Then, suddenly, the market completely flips to digital transactions. Now there are 566 Million users on mobile payments. It's incredible.

<strong>Greg</strong> - Consumer retail data is by far the newest tech. It's nothing new, but it's certainly a combination of technologies to make a decision. Apps can now track where you shop inside stores, if you bought an item, and so on. This leaves them with the data required to re-target you with a Facebook post for instance.

The panel then once again broke out into a 20 minute-long freestyle sessions of back-and-forth discussions about how tools like EventBank are using data. How do we combine this data responsibly, and who could they trust?
<h3>What's your buzzword of the day?</h3>
<strong>Greg - </strong>I think the main thing, the takeaway for me, is Respect.

<strong>Ravindra</strong> - I think there's not one keyword we can agree on without really coming back to Respect, aligning with what Greg said. Truly. This is a far created more social impact than we realize.

<strong>Edith</strong> - For me, when someone like KPMG asks for my information in exchange for something, I will give it to them. That's because I Trust them. It's all about Trust. Because I trust that KPMG will have full respect for the data.

<strong>Anson</strong> - Nowadays companies are very very transparent. It all boils down to respect.
<h3>That's a wrap</h3>
The event soon wrapped up to more networking, this time far more energized than at the beginning of the event. It was a great event that was full of laughs and learning, and the audience even had a chance to get involved with the panelists.

5844,"10 Strategies that Grow Your Association Memberships","What it takes to grow association memberships can be a challenge, yet it's still the engine that pushes communities to be engaged and impactful. Members are the face of your organization's network, and it's through them your association can standardize ethics and standards in any industry. With associations popping up left and right, niche organizations are quickly snapping up influencers and industry leaders into their ranks, and with that in mind, it's not only important to grow your membership for ROI reasons, but also to help retain the memberships you have.

It's important to know where your members hang out, congregate or otherwise cross paths with other potential members. This also doesn't mean just physical locations, but online circles as well. LinkedIn is a great place to get started in discovering where your potential members are lying. It's encouraged that you partake in regular discussions, commenting, and sharing your insights as well.

Being a part of the community within an industry is priority number one when it comes to building your audience. If you don't have the patience, you could always leverage these platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn by advertising your association in their feeds, but by all means, do not sacrifice your engagement with them.

Associations are not just known for hosting events. We dare say it's an obligation to host high quality and regular events for an association to even survive. Events are perfect ways to force paying members into getting their money's worth by engaging and interacting with other members, the public, and governments.

This is how associations the world-over impact social, political, and economic changes in their communities and industries. Without these events, you would never get your name out there in front of the eyes of curious would-be members.
<h2 id=""happy"">Keep Existing Members Happy</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5906 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_7533-Edit.jpg"" alt=""Keeping members happy"" width=""1920"" height=""1080"" />

Retaining your members are just as important as adding new ones to the association. You'll never reach your membership goals if you keep losing members. The core reason members leave is that they are unhappy with something.

There are ways to keep members happy with a blanket-engagement strategy that we'll list out for you, but most importantly, you should look inward to how your association is organized and try to pinpoint what makes your members upset. If that doesn't work, what are other associations closer to your industry doing that's working for them, and can you apply it to yours?

There are some great ways to keep members happy, and the primary way is through constant high-quality engagement. Pumping out Events, Meet &amp; Greets, Reward Programs, Implementing member feedback, social media engagement and more are great ways to keep everyone happy.

However, it's equally important to make sure that this engagement is tailored to each member. A little bit of personalization goes a long way, and that's why it's important to use association management software to your advantage when it comes to making content that's personalised in a way that doesn't take hours to do.

Here's more of the process in motion. 👇

<h2 id=""feedback"">Get Feedback from Current Members</h2>

Set up a system of regular, monthly is ideal, surveys to send out to your members, and get actionable feedback from the members themselves. This will always keep you in the loop for what changes your association needs to take in order to please members and improve your associations. The mere fact that you're making an attempt to listen to your members is enough to make you stand out as an association that care about it's members, and it makes members feel that they're valued.
<h2 id=""cards"">Provide Digital Membership Cards</h2>
<img class=""size-medium wp-image-5466 aligncenter"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-2-300x300.png"" alt=""Virtual Membership Cards"" />

Membership cards are a must-have for associations to help members feel they're truly a part of something special. However physical cards are going the way of the do-do bird. It's far more commonplace, and green, to use digital membership cards, all based on the same system used to register, manage, and engage with members.

Membership management software, including EventBank's, hosts a digital membership card feature that delivers membership cards immediately to new members with more benefits than a physical card will ever provide.

By leveraging the platform, membership cards are now finding homes in the phones of members these days. Every actionable stance a physical card has is now expanded by leveraging the phone's myriad of sensors and cameras allowing not only for normal use cases for physical membership cards, but also for allowing the ability to track that engagement in an actionable way.

It also saves us from chucking plastic away in the end.

<h2 id=""automate"">Automate the Renewal Process</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5484 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/EventBank-Membership-flow.png"" alt=""automate membership renewal reminders"" width=""1369"" height=""739"" />

With members joining at different times, with potentially varying lengths of memberships, it can be tedious to keep up with their activities, their exit dates, and when the best time to remind them is. There's even a surprising amount of associations out there that are not automating this process. Even some sadly never remind members due to the sheer manual time-taking task that it is.

By leveraging a membership management software with a built-in CRM and Contact Database, you'll be able to set-up a range of settings that automate the reminder emails and push notifications that get delivered to members to remind them when it's time to renew. This consistent and automated reminder system is key to not only growing your membership base, but also easing the workload.
<h2 id=""urgency"">Create Urgency</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1064 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_1924.jpg"" alt=""event planning"" width=""1620"" height=""1080"" />

Setting up time-based or limited count offers are a great way to push those potential members on the fence about joining your association to finally go through with the registration process. Making deals for holidays, or limited time offers push members to take deals that they wouldn't otherwise find in other associations, and it's also a great way to push other offers to current members as well.
<h2 id=""referral"">Create Referral Programs</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5848 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_7399-Edit.jpg"" alt=""business card exchange"" width=""1620"" height=""1080"" />

Referral programs are a great way to engage your current member base while also adding on fresh members. By offering rewards, discounts, extensions, and more, you'll be able to encourage current members into being part-time recruiters basically.

By being a part of your association's industry, it's likely they'll bring in engaged leads who are highly likely to convert into your new members. passing on this same referral program to new members then spreads the effectiveness to others, and it ends up becoming a great viral referral effect.
<h2 id=""welcome"">Create an Engaging Welcome Package</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5407 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/membership-welcome-package-2.png"" alt=""membership welcome package"" width=""1200"" height=""644"" />

Welcome packages are a great way to engage new members, and while they're good for engaging members, the long-term effect of having engaged members can have an influence on how word-of-mouth spreads about your association. Association membership growth is based on a lot of factors, and while there are marketing ways to do so, word-of-mouth is always the winner.

Members beget new members, and welcome packages are a great way to do so. Deliver Polo shirts, informational pamphlets, do-dads, and discount codes or offers. These little things educate and delight new members immediately, and it keeps members from regretting the decision to join. Here's a <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/craft-membership-welcome-package/"">great guide</a> that will get you on track with starting your own welcome package.
<h2 id=""&quot;social'"">Be Active on Social Media</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15303 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/eventbank-exploration-patterns-8-copy-8@2x.png"" alt=""membership social media"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

People spend 2.5 hours on social media each day. That's a huge chunk of someone's day glued to a media feed that's ripe for your association to be on and in their face.

But why do you want to be on there? Who is going to see it?

Essentially social media is the best place to make it look like your association is alive, at least in the beginning. Even if no one reacts, comments or shares your posts, it doesn't mean they're not unwanted in their feed. You'll slowly grow an audience over time, maybe it could use some extra nudging from your physical in-person meets and events to ask people to follow you. But in doing so you'll spread your message to those both in and outside of your circle.

Being acting on social media doesn't just mean posting regularly. That's half the battle. The other half is social listening. If you're not listening, you're not in the know.

By seeing who else is posting about related topics to your association, you'll be able to find opportunities for discussion, and you'll be able to put your association at the forefront of popular discussions and even some hot topics. By doing this, you'll attract followers and like-minded folks who may or may not be your members. This is a great opportunity to slip in some subtle CTAs that get them interested in joining your organization. As well, it's a great way to promote events and keep members up to date!

6142,"Success Story: How the Italian Chamber of Commerce Grew 30% with EventBank","This success story is a result of feedback received from the <a href=""https://www.icc.org.hk/"">Italian Chamber of Commerce Hong Kong &amp; Macau (Italian Chamber)</a> where a solution was needed to help move away from using tools that encouraged separation of databases, increased professionalism in the digital space, and grow members.

Here's what the Italian Chamber's General Manager, Anna Romagnoli, had to say about their experience with EventBank.

[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNycadr4h60[/embed]
<h2>Seeking Consolidation</h2>
As a Chamber of Commerce, the Italian Chamber relies heavily on the management and engagement that's necessary to deal with contacts and members without spending a lot of time dealing with these objectives. In the beginning, the Italian Chamber utilized spreadsheets (as most member-based organizations do) to manage members, and later with the advent of CRMs, adopted Salesforce.

However, Salesforce could only manage contacts and email engagement then had to come from MailChimp. As needs arose and so on, tool-after-tool was used to ease the pressure, but in the end, this multi-tool approach only served to separate contact databases and made it increasingly complex to manage.

Salesforce was simply too complicated and the need to use further tools to engage members and manage events only added to the confusion for junior staff at the Italian Chamber, leaving more responsibility on the shoulders of senior management to do basic tasks like knowing who was a member and who wasn't. The mindset now was to find a one-stop solution that was able to contribute to all necessary tasks, in a simple manner as possible, while keeping all the data in one place.

<h2>Search for all-in-one Chamber Software</h2>
This propelled the Italian Chamber to seek a platform that could harmonize all their databases into one, automate member engagement, and manage events with a full suite of options. After swiftly seeking throughout solution-after-solution EventBank's <a href=""https://www.eventbank.com/solutions/association-chamber-management-cloud/"">Chamber of Commerce Management Softwar</a>e was eventually chosen after getting in touch through our representatives in Hong Kong at the time.
<h2>The Results</h2>
<img class=""alignright wp-image-9152 size-full"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/icchk-event@2x.png"" alt=""italian chamber of commerce hong kong, event page example, attendee engagement"" width=""1256"" height=""1080"" />

Soon after the adoption of the EventBank platform, migration of the data from an assortment of previous software became an immediate challenge. The first six months were indeed a bit difficult to adapt to, and the new platform required intense on-boarding coordination from EventBank to help the Italian Chamber migrate data into one place. This is a typical reaction when data gets separated and staff becomes accustomed to tools prior to using EventBank. These are the types of challenges most organizations may face when changing solutions, but the Italian Chamber was assigned an experienced Customer Success Manager who was and continues to be there to help the Chamber with anything they might need.

The Italian Chamber's General Manager Anna Romagnoli says that any chamber of commerce out there that seeks to find an all-in-one solution like EventBank will need to dive into the deep end and make sure someone with IT passion who understands the chamber is taking full control and seriousness of the platform. Initially, the Italian Chamber approached the migration with a tentative mindset and because of that, the on-boarding process took longer than expected.

Regardless, after 6 months the on-boarding process was completed in full color, and the Italian Chamber was able to move junior staff into an engagement and management position on the platform. This further consolidated all of the Italian Chamber's data into the EventBank platform, which reduced management needs as all necessary lists and their associated tool for each task was all available in one place.

With the new platform in place, and in the past 3 years from problem-to-solution, Italian Chamber has seen a near-30% hike in membership growth. Romagnoli remarks that while there is not singular benefit that she can point out about the EventBank platform that caused this rapid growth, it is very likely the wide range of benefits, both intrinsic and extrinsic to the EventBank experience, contributed to making the Italian Chamber one of the fastest-growing chambers in Asia.

This includes the automation of membership renewals, push notifications via EventBank mobile app, email campaigns, event page set up, and the complete professional look and feel when members register for the events, apply for and manage their memberships or receive the communication from the chamber.

9668,"Success Story: How SASTM is Achieving Long-term Growth with EventBank","This success story is a result of feedback received from the <a href=""//www.sastm.org.za/"">South African Society of Travel Medicine</a> (SASTM) where a solution was needed to help update a legacy database built specifically for SASTM, but lacked support due to aging tech. The responses are a result of success with EventBank tackling this massive migration, which had surprised SASTM with other tertiary benefits an association would find while adopting EventBank including event page creation, ticketing, mobile apps, and 24/7 support.
<h2>Legacy to Legendary.</h2>
The SASTM traditionally hosted it's data, including contacts and their details, on a custom-built database software system nearly 10 years prior to this Success Story. This system was customized precisely and iterated upon by supporting staff from the developers, and through this support had been able to leverage the system for all its engagement and management needs for both events and contacts, or any other campaign run by the SASTM. However, as technology advances, on-campus systems have become legacy, and support for these systems is waning, which includes SASTM's system.

The SASTM is an active organization in Africa, attending multiple events, talks, and discussions across South Africa and cross-border. In doing so, they crossed paths with EventBank in 2018 at Meetings Africa, an event for the <a href=""https://get.eventbank.com/event-automation-software-meetings-africa/"">growing MICE industry in Africa</a>. With the goal of finding a new database provider that could mimic that of SASTM's prior database, a quick exchange with EventBank CEO Eric L. Schmidt showed quickly the potential match between the two entities.

In December of 2018, SASTM adopted EventBank as it's database and engagement solution.

The challenge at-hand for SASTM now is to ride the learning curve of migrating from a system that's been instilled into the lifeblood of their organization for the past 10 years, relearn new features, and properly migrate data within their full spectrum of the legacy database.
<h2>The Results</h2>
SASTM's adoption of the EventBank platform was rocky, to be frank. But this is an often typical occurrence when migrating from a legacy database to a modern one, especially one that's based on cloud-software like EventBank. This comes from the mass customization of prior data and finding out who can indeed match their database apples-to-apples. There's also a time-frame where staff will need to retrain themselves.

This isn't the first time an organization hit the learning curve harder than expected. <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/awa-success-story/"">Check out AWA's struggles and eventual success</a> with the EventBank platform.

This is, however, a challenge that becomes easily hurdled as long as the new database, in this case, EventBank, provides true 24/7 customer support to migrating clients, and SASTM based in South Africa, is no exception. EventBank staff was able to communicate with SASTM Development Executive Marion Blewett and smooth over the transition to the new platform. This included onboarding sessions, training, and on-the-spot support.

<strong> Marion Blewett</strong>Development Director, South African Society of Travel Medicine.</blockquote>

Once these initial challenges were handled and gaps in the migration were bridged, it was nearly immediate that SASTM felt the positive impact EventBank had on its membership engagement and event management needs. The SASTM's goal of consolidating data in one place was easily the first objective completed and in doing so, leaving more options on the table than likely expected.
<h2>Moving out of the 'Dark Ages'</h2>
Since the completion of the migration and the continued training and orientation, they've run one conference with EventBank where they reported that leveraging EventBank felt like moving out of the 'Dark Ages'. Registrations and applications were run smoothly and seamlessly that allowed for continued and automotive updating of contact data in the platform even while the event was offline.

SASTM encourages other associations in a similar situation to dive head-first into cloud technologies like EventBank, as being hesitant, or otherwise abrasive to the migration experience can artificially slow down the learning curve process, and hinder future growth. This is a similar situation to other associations, <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/awa-success-story/"">like in our AWA article</a>, where customized and otherwise on-campus systems are hard to detach from in lieu of a platform that updated without much input. The end results are worth the pain of leaving behind old but familiar tech.

9690,"5 Secrets to Membership Pricing Strategies","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before the actual moment that a consumer decides to subscribe to a company’s membership package, there is a great deal of time and thought that goes into choosing one company over another and one package over another. It is very important that a consumer feels like they are getting the most out of what they are paying for, so membership pricing strategies are extremely powerful in gaining more members. The way your company chooses the packages that are made available to the consumer and the way in which these packages are presented is pivotal to increasing memberships. <br /><br />So, how are you working to increase your memberships? Consider these 5 membership pricing strategies to find one or more that will fit your association.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 id=""top"">Jump to Strategy</h3>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""trials"">Free Trials</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Utilizing a free trial is a great membership pricing strategy if your company presents it properly. A free trial can be as short or long as your association sees fit. The most important part is making sure that your association offers the consumer something valuable in this trial time period. <br /><br />For example, the <a href=""//climateofficers.org/30daytrial"">Association of Climate Chang Officers (ACCO)</a> offers a 30-day free trial that includes benefits such as free online training and access to their knowledge center resources. These initial, free benefits that a member would get for the first month are great to a consumer because they feel they are getting a valuable service without having to pay any money for a month. <br /><br />If a consumer is able to see all of the benefits of joining your association without the upfront financial commitment, they are likely to continue being a member of your association. <br /><br />A key factor to this pricing strategy is understanding that consumers attracted by free trials may react differently than regular consumers. In a study released in<a href=""//phys.org/news/2015-02-consumer-behavior-free-trials-customer.html""> The Journal of Marketing Research</a><em>, </em>it was clear that user experience is pivotal in making consumers attracted by free trial pricing strategies stay because new customers need to have a comprehensive understanding of the benefits your association provides. <br /><br />Paired with marketing communication, using free trials as a membership pricing strategy can be very powerful.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""newmember"">New Member Promotion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some associations use a membership pricing strategy we call a Joining Promotion. This strategy is essentially a promotion for registering or applying to become a member of your association. Instead of a free trial, a joining promotion is usually something that the customer receives once they register, but they still pay for the initial registration.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <a href=""//www.ffta.org/page/NewMembershipPromotions"">Family-Focused Treatment Association (FFTA)</a> is currently offering a free conference registration to their 33rd Annual Conference to anyone that registers before June 28th. This promotion encourages consumers to become a FFTA member by giving them something in exchange for purchase of membership.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Using a joining promotion as a membership pricing strategy might be a better fit for your association if you think that consumers that opt for a free trial will not be able to clearly understand the benefits of a membership with your association without extensive marketing and user experience efforts.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""multiple"">Multiple Edition</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The multiple edition strategy uses different packages, or groupings of their benefits, to cater to different consumer types. This membership pricing strategy works extremely well as it can allow consumers to find a package that fits their specific needs. For example, a small business or individual may not have a need for the same resources that a large corporate business would. <br /><br />The <a href=""//www.amchamchina.org/membership/"">American Chamber of Commerce</a> in China utilizes this pricing strategy as they offer both corporate and individual packages. They even break down these two categories into subcategories of large, small and venture for corporate and individual and other professionals for individuals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By adding different membership options to your portfolio, your association will be able to let the consumer choose what is best for them and get the most for what they are spending.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""options"">Keep Options Simple</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While giving your consumers different options can allow them to pick an option that suits them, it is very important to remember this membership pricing strategy: Keep Options Simple. Even though consumers do want to feel like they can pick a membership that best represents their needs, consumers often get overwhelmed if there are too many options.<br /><br />If your association offers too many different packages for each type of consumer, they will likely get flustered weighing the different choices. It is best to keep your options clear and simple for the customer, so they are able to understand what you are offering and do not have to list off pros and cons for multiple different options. <br /><br />It is also important to keep the way in which you write the prices of your packages simple. A study published in the <a href=""//www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1057740811001082"">Journal of Consumer Psychology</a> finds numbers that use commas and decimals appear to be larger because of their syllabic length. So, your association can use the membership pricing strategy of keeping things simple by limiting the number of packages you offer as well as presenting prices without commas and decimals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""showcase"">Showcase Offering</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The last membership pricing strategy that your association could use to increase your memberships is called showcase offering. Showcase offerings highlight the most expensive and extensive package that your association offers in the hopes of making the other, smaller packages look inexpensive in comparison. <br /><br />Associations will show the super-premium option as being expensive, and most consumers will settle for something in the middle. This strategy can sometimes use a compromise effect which emphasizes the middle option as the most popular among consumers. By showing a premium option and then showing a less expensive, more popular option right next to it, consumers are drawn to a middle package.</p>

<h2>Which Membership Pricing Strategy is for You?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With 5 different powerful membership pricing strategies to choose from, you might be wondering which would be best for your association, but ultimately, that is up to you! <br /><br />To choose which strategy fits your association, make sure to focus on who your target audience is, and how you believe they will respond to the different options. <br /><br />It could even be beneficial to your association to blend together some of the strategies we have mentioned. For example, your association might want to use showcase offering to make your lower price options appear inexpensive. This could be combined with the multiple edition strategy to not only highlight the low prices of the smallest package, but also to give options that cater to different consumers. <br /><br />If you feel your association has a wide variety of consumers ranging from individuals to large corporate companies, adding on the multiple edition strategy to another pricing strategy might be best for you. <br /><br />Ultimately, we know that the way that a consumer is presented information is extremely important to their decision to join or not join your association. To make sure that you present your membership packages the proper way, consider who you are catering towards and which strategy best fits your audience.</p>
