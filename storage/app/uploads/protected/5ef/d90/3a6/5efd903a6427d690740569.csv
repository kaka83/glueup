We've done the research and found 8 membership benefits ideas that your association should be using to keep your members engaged and wanting more!</p>

<h2 id=""communication"">Member-Only Communication</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To make sure that your members are getting the most out of your association, create ways to increase communication within your association. Members will enjoy the benefits of being able to connect and communicate with their fellow members. This membership benefits idea will allow your members to further grow their network and develop even more as professionals. <br /><br />For example, a useful application that your association should take advantage of is <a href=""//www.groupahead.com/"">GroupAhead</a>. This app is customizable to your specific association as it allows you to choose the actual app icon, add your own custom links, and import your events to the apps calendar. Specific to communication though, this app only allows your members to join, so they can easily communicate through messages with one another. Any member can also post pictures to the associations platform for everyone on the app to view, like, and comment on. <br /><br /></p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For keeping up with relevant community information and important event promotions, your association should utilize <a href=""//www.eventbank.com"">EventBank</a>. This app can also be helpful in encouraging community members to communicate and make connections. This type of technology would be great for your association because it would allow constant communication between your members that would make them want to renew their membership as they have forged meaningful connections with other members.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Strengthening communication between your association and your members is also extremely important. If a member has any questions or concerns about your association or their membership, it would be helpful to have a place where they can reach out and get their questions answered.<br /><br />Need to learn more about automating your communication at scale? <strong>Book a demo</strong> and learn more about EventBank's membership automation solutions.</p>

<h2 id=""career"">Career Opportunities</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Career Development Tools Offering a variety of career development tools is a great membership benefits idea that your association should be using. It is easy to offer a few tools to your members, but making sure that there is a variety of these tools and experiences will keep your members coming back. <br /><br />One career development tool that your members would love is some type of resume service. A resume service could be an online bank of templates that guide your members and allow them to create very professional looking resumes. It could also be a resume workshop where members can attend and learn how to build them a great resume while meeting and networking with fellow members. Some associations offer online resume workshops that are free to their members. <br /><br />For example, <a href=""//www.acacamps.org/staff-professionals/events-professional-development/recorded-webinar/resume-writing-interview-skills-workshop"">The American Camp Association</a> offers hundreds of online course to their members, one of which is a resume writing and interview skills workshop.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another career development tool that your members would love is a members-only job board software. This software would bring together major employers and show job postings for members to view and apply for. Members would be allowed the opportunity to see these new job posts and even narrow their searches to their location or job title. <br /><br />It is important to remember that career development tools should also include events that will encourage members to learn more but also network with other professionals. <br /><br />One example of an event that your association could put on is a career advancement speaker series. Many of your members could come and learn more about specific topics that all have to do with career advancement and network at the same time. Being that in-person events do connect to sales, your members would appreciate opportunities to meet and talk amongst each other.</p>

<h2 id=""webinar"">Useful Webinars</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although it is a great membership benefit to have in-person events, with the busy world that we live in, it is not always realistic to do everything in person. A great membership benefits idea for your members that cannot always come to events in person is introducing a webinar. <br /><br />Webinars are great for providing information and replacing an in-person meeting. The key to creating a quality webinar is first picking a relevant topic to cover. Your members will want to tune in to something that they find interesting or that gives a new perspective that they do not know much about.<br /><br />For example, the <a href=""//amcham.eventbank.cn/event/webinar-export-compliance-working-group-meeting-with-kevin-kurland-21999/"">American Chamber of Commerce China</a> is offering a webinar to its members only on May 15, 2019, on the topic of Export Compliance Working Group Meeting with Kevin Kurland. This webinar is only available to AmCham members and has both a relevant topic and an interesting speaker.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you have decided on a topic, it is important to make sure that after the actual speech or seminar, you leave time for questions. Oftentimes your members will relate what they have learned in the webinar to their business or line of work, and they will have questions that can help them personally. <br /><br />If your members feel like they are learning something and getting questions answered that can help their business, they will feel your service is valuable.</p>

<h2 id=""affinity"">Affinity Programs</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":9804} -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An affinity program is when your association teams up with another business or association to allow for mutual benefits. Affinity programs can be a great membership benefits idea because your association will be providing discounts and new opportunities to members through the other business that you team up with. <br /><br />Together with your partnered business, your association can create benefits that you think your members will enjoy using. When your members get discounts from other businesses, this will improve their overall experience with your association. <br /><br />For example, the <a href=""//secure.acce.org/wiki/affinity-programs/"">Association of Chamber of Commerce Executives </a>(ACCE) has multiple affinity programs including a partnership with Aventura World, an international travel planning program. Members of ACCE will get discounts and benefits from Aventura World because of ACCE's partnership with Aventura World. For members, this affinity program could be extremely beneficial and make their experience with ACCE very positive.</p>

<h2 id=""content"">Engaging Content</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":5882} -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the most important membership benefits is actually one of the most simple ones: frequently release engaging content to your members. If your association is not engaging with your members, they will easily get bored and potentially not renew their subscription the next year. To make sure that your members do not get bored, create varied, engaging content, and put this content out OFTEN. <br /><br />First, make sure that your association is creating content that can be released in different forms on different platforms. If your association is only creating email newsletters, your members may feel uninterested after a while. There are so many different platforms to release engaging content, and your association should be utilizing them. <br /><br />Besides newsletters, a few membership benefits ideas could include releasing content via blog posts, webinars, free guides, and even ebooks. By varying the platform on which your content is presented, you will always keep your members on their toes. <br /><br />Next, and most importantly, make sure your content is engaging. If you are releasing content on different platforms but none of your members want to read it, your content is extremely unsuccessful. To ensure that you are creating content that your members will want to read, think about your audience. On a basic level, think about your members and what that they will be interested in. <br /><br />You can also get a better idea about what your members want by actually asking them what they would want to learn about. If you involve your members in the content creation process by asking them for ideas, they will be more interested in reading your future content. With this in mind, one way to create engaging content is by including interactive aspects in the content you produce. For example, your association could create a quiz for your members to take and give them the results just after they have taken it. <br /><br />Lastly, your association should make sure that you are releasing content often. To make sure that you don't lose your members, frequency is key. As much as it is good to keep your members on their toes in terms of what platform you will be releasing information on, they should also feel like there is a consistency in terms of when information is given. There should not be month long gaps in between sending or posting content. <br /><br />Ultimately, your members want to feel like they are receiving membership benefits that are significant to them. By creating engaging, interactive content and releasing it often, your members will feel heard and important.</p>

<h2 id=""discounts"">Member Discounts</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":5406} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img class=""wp-image-5406"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/add-on-woocommerce-member-discounts-771x386.png"" alt=""Membership Discount"" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just as it is crucial to vary your associations content, it is also imperative to have variation in the discounts that your association offers. Instead of doing the same discount for an event, try to find fun ways to give members quality discounts. <br /><br />One membership benefits idea that would help your association would be changing up the products that you have discounts on. Maybe your association could find a monthly product or service to offer a discount on. With this, your members will feel they are getting more from their membership. <br /><br />Another creative membership discount idea is implementing a discount for big anniversaries such as your associations birthday. Maybe give a discount code that has the actual date of your associations birthday or have the percentage off be a number that is related to the actual birthday. <br /><br />Lastly, your association should also consider giving special discounts to members that have been with your association for a long period of time. To encourage member loyalty, these discounts could be given after 5, 10, and 20 years of being a member. This allows individual members to feel special and feel rewarded for being a part of your association.</p>

<h2 id=""mentor"">Mentor Programs</h2>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A mentoring program is a great membership benefits idea for your association because it encourages your members to forge relationships with one another. A mentor program can be extremely effective and eventually benefits both the mentor and the mentee. <br /><br />For a mentor program to work, your association should come up with some guidelines. First, your association should consider how long someone has to be a member of your association before they can be eligible to be a mentor. <br /><br />Next, your association should make sure that you are pairing people up who have similar interests, industries, and maybe are geographically close to one another. The better your association pairs mentors and mentees together, the more the members will benefit from this program. <br /><br />Your association could also allow your members to pick who their mentor or mentee is based on who they think will be valuable to their professional development.</p>

<h2 id=""volunteer"">Volunteer Opportunities</h2>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The final membership benefit idea that your association can use to get your members to renew their subscription is presenting unique volunteer opportunities. Your members will love the chance to be involved in supporting an important cause while gaining professional experience. <br /><br />Any volunteer opportunity would allow your members to make a positive impact on a cause. Usually, when someone does something giving and generous, they will feel a sense of fulfillment from being a part of something bigger than themselves. If you as an association are able to give this feeling to your members, they will associate those good memories and feelings with your association. <br /><br />Your members can also learn new skills depending on the volunteer position that they take on. These new skills can be transferred to their resume which further benefits their professional development.</p>

<p>As an association, you need your members, and you need them to be engaged. When you're thinking about finding ways to engage members that might be disengaged, consider these 8 membership benefits. <br /><br />When your members feel like they are getting a plethora of benefits that they could not be getting elsewhere, they will be drawn to stay with your association. <br /><br />Consider trying some of these membership benefits ideas, and see what your members think. Ask for their opinions and feedback! You may find that your members want benefits that your association can give, but had not even considered yet.</p>

9814,"How to Convert Event Traffic into Web Traffic","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A successful event is one where your audience is engaged and where this engagement translates into the kind of conversions you want to see. For most businesses, that means helping your attendees to go from spectator to committed customer or follower.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are so <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/define-event-engagement-panel/"">many ways to boost your event conversions</a>, but a lot of people forget that one of the best is their current website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All of your other marketing, including your social media campaigns, direct marketing and most other advertising points your leads towards your website. So, it makes sense to focus on directing your event traffic there as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are five of the best ways you can make it happen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Host your event landing page on your website</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":2775} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img class=""wp-image-2775"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/EventBank.png"" alt=""EventBank Event Management Software"" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Creating a dedicated event website can be perfect for some.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, rather than investing time and energy setting up a new domain that won’t be available after your event, focus your energy on directing traffic to the website you already have. Particularly if it’s where you sell your products or services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Create your event landing page on your existing site. Instead of linking directly to your event management software in your posts across social media, divert via your website for further details and make the link to booking prominent on that page.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Using your own website works for two reasons:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1) Some of the pre-event traffic you drive to your site will hang around and look at other pages (e.g. About Us, or your services pages).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2) Once people have seen your website, know your URL and have it in their browser history, they’ll know where to find you to follow up after the event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Creating a dedicated landing page on a prominent part of your website and promote it on your Home Page, through internal links and on your social media channels, is the best way to maximise web traffic in the lead up to your event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Provide an incentive to follow up on the web</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":3292} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img class=""wp-image-3292"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Email-Campaigns-Ad-Copy@2x-1024x549.png"" alt=""event email marketing guide"" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You already know it’s good practice to include your website’s URL in all your event materials (print advertising, online advertising, banners, presentations, etc.), but how about giving people a real, tangible reason to follow through on all of those prompts?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Running an incentive aimed at driving traffic to your website can be incredibly effective. But, what can you use to motivate people?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hold a contest and announce the winner/s on your blog</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This can work really well, but you need to really understand your audience to pick the right prize and method for your contest. Once you’ve got the perfect scheme, you can inform people about it as part of your pre-event marketing and during your event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most importantly, announce the winner/s on your blog. Do not reveal your winner/s directly on social media, but instead link to the announcement on your website. The resulting traffic will give your blog a boost and motivate people to have a look at other pages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Offer value-added products</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":3149} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img class=""wp-image-3149"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/swag-bag@2x-1024x535.png"" alt=""swag bag ideas"" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your event time is always going to be limited. If you have a lot to offer (which I don’t doubt you do), you can share more by creating in-depth information on topics covered during your events and giving it away for free in exchange for free registration to a blog, newsletter or other gated asset.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your value-added product might be an eBook, special blog-series, webinar or online course. Most importantly, it should expand on the themes of your event and offer genuine value for your audience. This approach will not only see your web traffic increase but also create a loyal customer/follower-base that lasts long into the future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Use your event URL to round-up/follow-up on your event</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":3126} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img class=""wp-image-3126"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/webdesign-3411373_1920-1024x683.jpg"" alt=""event website builder"" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just because your event is over doesn’t mean you have to consign its web page to the cyber wastelands. It can still breath life. Use it to follow up on something you discussed during your event. Or, add links to relevant blog posts that round-up, report on, or offer commentary on your event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s easier for people to connect your brand to your event if your landing page is consistent. So, this tactic ensures maximum click-through from your off-page channels like your social media.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Use your website to encourage event-based user-generated content</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the best ways to generate interest in your follow-up media is to include your attendees in the concept.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can request photo submissions and comments directly from your audience and feature their media prominently on your website. It helps people feel connected to your brand and demonstrates the value you place in their input and continued involvement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your networking skills are up to scratch, you’re very likely to connect with people on social media during and following your event. Running a post-event user-generated content campaign through these platforms and linking these to your website, will direct high-quality, engaged web traffic your way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Prepare your website for increased traffic</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the biggest and simplest mistakes people make when embarking on any marketing campaign is to forget to prepare their website for an increase in traffic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I get it. You don’t want to be overly optimistic and fork out money to prepare for something that might not happen. But, many-a-business has been <a href=""//blog.hubspot.com/marketing/12-small-brands-that-went-viral"">caught short when they go viral</a>, or see a huge increase in traffic, only to watch their efforts crumble into a sea of website downtime.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your hosting plan doesn’t include enough bandwidth to deal with the traffic increase you project to see from your event, you’ve already failed. The quickest way to lose new interest is for your website to be unavailable when they need it. So, <a href=""//www.ukwebhostreview.com/free-web-hosting/"">check whether your free web host</a> or premium plan includes enough bandwidth to handle the extra traffic before you go to the effort of driving it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Running events can be one of the most exciting and rewarding ways to generate interest in what you do. But many miss out on the opportunity to truly capitalize on their success. Your website is your hub. It’s where all of your marketing (digital or otherwise) directs people to. So, your events should be no different. Armed with these simple and easy to action tips, both your event and your web traffic will be unstoppable.</p>

<p>Two forces of change are sweeping organizations, and that's the eco-friendly stance of most companies and organizations, and as well the need to leverage smartphones to the best of their ability when it comes to user experience. Digital membership cards that exist within a member's smartphone is a strategy and tool that fits perfectly within these campaigns for a neater and greener member experience. <br /><br />A physical membership card can unlock doors, hold values, check-in members at events, give discounts, and identify the member. All of these things can be re-created in a digital membership card that exists on a member's phone, and then leverages that phone's sensors, cameras, and other gadgets on-board that can re-create a physical card's capabilities as a membership card. <br /><br />Not only is this easily deployed to members who sign up to your association, but now it's easily managed from as software in the back-end that tracks all of a user's actions taken, as well as revoke permissions for lower tier members or giving special privileges to VIP members.<br /><br />All this while being green for the environment and cutting out that wasteful plastic build-up.</p>

<h2>1. Simple and Clean</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The University of Massachusetts Amherst’s Alumni Association created the membership card design shown above, and it works perfectly for their needs. For a classic, large organization this membership card design is both simple and clean to cater to all of its’ members. It is not too flashy or showy because it has more of a focus on being academic and sophisticated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The colors that are chosen are also perfect for this specific association because they match the school’s colors. When you are choosing your membership card design, be sure to focus on the details such as color because each element makes a difference in how your members will view your association’s brand. This simple and clean design could be perfect for your association with a little tweaking and personalization.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>2. Classic yet Creative</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":9849,""align"":""center"",""width"":454,""height"":454} -->
<div class=""wp-block-image"">

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The East End Trades Guild has mastered the art of combining the classics with a creative style. While the colors are cool and the font is easily legible, the logo art adds personality to this membership card design. If you feel that your association has room for some creativity, then you should consider looking into nice logo art that could liven up your membership card design. This card does not have too much going on, but it captures the brand of the Trades Guild in a way that would entice a member and tell the story of the association.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>3. Textured and Unique</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":9850,""align"":""center"",""width"":559,""height"":372} -->

</div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One very unique way to showcase your association’s personality is by creating a textured membership card. The card shown above does a great job of implementing texture as part of their membership card design. Members will feel like this card is not just the usual membership card, but it is special.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not only does the design look unique and interesting, but on a basic level, it feels different to touch which physically separates it from all of the other cards in your member’s wallet. An interesting texture does not always have to be as creative as the one in this example. Your association could use a sleek material like this black metal and do more simple design and the textured card would still be nice to your members.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>4. Elegant and Sleek</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":9847,""align"":""center"",""width"":455,""height"":295} -->

</div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another great membership card design would be choosing something very elegant and sleek to communicate your association’s exclusivity. This type of design with a modern font and simple, classic colors would show your members the brand that your association is going for. If you want to have a card for members that have the highest or best membership subscription, this membership card design will make them feel one of a kind. The Covette Clinic does a great job of designing a membership card that communicates luxury, so their members will feel like even their membership card design is consistent with a luxury brand.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>5. Gold Member Card</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":9848,""align"":""center"",""width"":443,""height"":286} -->
<div class=""wp-block-image"">

</div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The last membership card design that your association should take a look at is any type of “Gold Card” design. The idea of having a gold card, the highest of them all, will give your members a feeling of pride when they use this card. They do not just have a simple, regular member card, but they are a “gold member” and it shows on their card. This example from OneWorld exclusive gold club is just one example of an association that uses a gold card system. Because gold is associated with wealth, this color communicates to its members that they are of high status.</p>

<h2>What about Digital Membership Cards?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Choosing what membership card design your association should use can be tough, but hopefully, these different examples will give you some ideas as to what could be best for you! There are numerous benefits of providing your members with a physical membership card, which is why we suggest that you come up with a great membership card design to make your physical card stand out to your members.

9897,"10 Effective Membership Retention Strategies & Ideas","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, you’ve just gone through the intensive work of getting a new member onto your list. After hours upon hours of constant meetings, they finally signed with your organization. All the hard work is over finally, right? Not even close. To sign a member is one thing but could you imagine if you went through all of this time and money for this individual to not renew their agreement with your organization the following year? Membership retention is key, and it is certainly one of the greatest challenges for most membership-based organizations. <br /><br />Although there’s an initial attraction when getting a new customer, membership retention is better not only when it comes to the amount of time, but also the money spent when trying to get a new contact. But don’t worry; we’ve done the hard work for you. Here’s a list of 10 membership retention strategies and ideas that'll keep your members coming back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Jump to a Strategy</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""#audience"">Target Audience Focus</a><br /><a href=""#incentives"">Long-Term Incentives</a><br /><a href=""#oboarding"">On-Boarding Focus</a><br /><a href=""#suffocation"">Avoid Member Suffocation</a><br /><a href=""#communication"">Customize Communication Channels</a><br /><a href=""#software"">Adopt Membership Software</a> (<strong>New!</strong>)<br /><a href=""#survey"">Survey Existing Customers</a><br /><a href=""#reinforce"">Reinforce Membership Benefits</a><br /><a href=""#events"">Run Attractive Events</a><br /><a href=""#perks"">Offer Perks &amp; Benefits</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""audience"">Focus in on Your Target Audience</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Membership retention begins at the forefront of your organization. If your organization aims to just attract anyone that will give you money, you’re more likely to have a much higher churn rate. The reason for this is because your membership could not possibly be completely universal, some people will love the membership, and others will not. This is inevitable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, to cut down on those who do not fully enjoy the membership, companies need to avoid the common mistake of targeting a market that is too wide. Without knowing the specifics of who you are trying to attract, it can make it really hard to retain all of your customers. <br /><br />This leads to members joining with the wrong expectations and is a common trend when it comes to the decline of membership retention.<br /><br />Instead, focus this excess time and money on those who are already long-term advocates for your organization. They are the ones that clearly identify with your core service model and continue to resonate with your organization.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":9898,""align"":""center""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter""><img class=""wp-image-9898"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-14.png"" alt=""Focus in on your Target Audience"" /></figure>
</div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you focus on a specific group, your business model becomes clearer, with the ability to resonate with these specific people rather than wasting the time and money on individuals who are not looking to become long term advocates for your organization.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""incentives"">Focus on Long Term Incentives to Boost Membership Retention</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, you’ve reeled in your new potential customer with a short-term incentive plan that benefits only the new potential member. It is possible that you have not yet taken into account whether or not they are a part of your selected targeted audience and if they will actually be long-term users of your organization. <br /><br />Although short-term incentives may boost membership quickly when the renewal of a full-priced membership comes around it can be extremely difficult to retain these members after paying your rate at a discounted price. Often at this time, you would yet again see a trend in higher churn rates, of customers who simply do not see the value in the organization at this full price point.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":9899,""align"":""center""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter""><img class=""wp-image-9899"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-15.png"" alt="""" /></figure>
</div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because of this, it is key to keep rewards for new members limited. Not only will these new members not get used to the temporary benefits of a new user, but existing customers may also find a disparity between their loyalty to the organization and the benefits that the new bees are receiving for simply signing up.<br /><br />Instead, continue to reward and incentivize your already dedicated and present user base. Not only will this increase membership retention but it will reduce the number of individuals that simply signed up for the discounted price, and not for the product/service itself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""onboarding"">Focus on Onboarding</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, the customer has just signed with your association. Time to start developing a solid relationship with this new member through the continuation of a beginning onboarding process. The first year of membership with an individual is crucial when it comes to membership retention rates. It is the first impression they have of your organization and just like a dinner at a nice restaurant, it could decide if they choose to come back or not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

</div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through new member onboarding, you can assist this process of guiding the way for members to immediately see the value in the organization, with the intent to keep coming back. <br /><br />By having a new member onboarding plan your organization will be able to assess the member’s interests, needs, and goals. You can personalize and educate new members about the different ways to get value from the membership through things such as in-person/online educational programs, website resources, newsletters, networking events, etc. <br /><br />By beginning this channel of clear feedback at the very beginning, you are also able to strengthen your relationship with the new members so they do not lose sight of the value your organization provides. <br /><br />Welcome your new members and physically show them that the organization appreciates their business. This welcome can either be in the form of a physical welcome gift, or even a simple template email sent to everyone as soon as they click “submit” on their application. <br /><br />Our article on <a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/craft-membership-welcome-package/"">7 Steps to Crafting Your Ideal Membership Welcome Package</a> will have you welcoming your new members like a pro, and lists many unique options to make your new members feel the most valued.</p>

<p>We’ve all been there… scrolling and deleting hundreds of emails from a variety of different companies that seem to email you every single day. It seems like a never-ending cycle of receiving and deleting spam emails to the point where you don’t even read the title or sender address anymore. Yet you can’t seem to muster up the energy to simply unsubscribe yourself from the email chain. <br /><br />Although good intentions, companies tend to lose their leverage when they choose to suffocate new members with the constant flow of information through email. Because of that, after the initial onboarding process is finished, companies should look at a more hands-off approach for these individuals over the next three to six months. There is no point in “overdoing” contact with new members if they simply are not going to look through the information you are sending them. <br /><br />Instead, take them out of the loop with “heavy” email chains every day. Opt for a handoff approach, sending the occasional email just to check in. At the three-month mark, continue to email them a list of educational opportunities and new benefits that have recently come up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This will keep your emails from getting overlooked and instead, members are still being kept up to date with new educational activities and benefits, without the association of pesky mass emails with your organization. At the six-month mark, the new members have a decent grasp on what the organization is about. Because of this, reach out with information that highlights upcoming both local and national association events.</p>

</div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As stated at the beginning of this article, there is no such thing as a “one size fits all” membership for individuals. Members enjoy when interactions are customizable and are able to fit their daily needs in a way that is most beneficial to them as a whole. Creating ways to customize this channel of communication between you and your client is key, not only from a membership retention strategy standpoint but also, for a better outlook of your organization. <br /><br />Personalized subject lines in emails are more likely to be opened and must be used for the member to acknowledge their personal value to the organization. We all know we get the daily spam mass email that is sent to an organization’s entire email list. This reduces the likelihood of that person opening the message because people assume that it was just sent to everyone, with no acknowledgment of the person's individuality.</p>

<h2 id=""survey"">Survey Existing Customers</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter""><img class=""wp-image-9904"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-20.png"" alt=""Survey members so you can find out why they're leaving. "" /></figure>
</div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It can be easy to assume looking from the outside of what exactly your members want, and how their ideals fit within your own idea of a perfect membership. These assumptions of what the member’s want can lead to a gap in communication and therefore the business may not know what the members are actually in need of. <br /><br />To mend this communication barrier and boost membership retention, send out a survey to existing customers to find their own personal preferences and how well they are interacting with your association. With the use of these surveys, businesses get an insider view of what current members want to make sure they are getting their needs met. Not only do they get their needs met, but it also gives customers the reassurance that their membership with the organization is being valued and is actively choosing to reach out to get their own opinion on how things are going. <br /><br />It is also important to survey new members 6 to 9 months into the first year of their membership. This survey is to see if the new members are able to see the value in their own membership with the organization. Taking suggestions from these surveys will not only keep your clients happy, but it will also increase membership retention rates significantly by receiving your information directly from the source. <br /><br />Although surveys sent out to current members are important, it is also critical to get the opinion of those who choose to opt out of their membership. To do this, perform “exit interviews” if the member is open to it, and see why exactly they decided to leave. Companies use exit interviews to gage aspects such as the work culture, daily concerns, processes, issues with management, ethics, and employee morale. <br /><br />Exit interviews are a way to gain information that otherwise would not have been possible if they were still in the membership. If you focus on the reasons why people are not choosing to renew with your business, you will hopefully be able to hone in on these aspects and eventually fix the problem of lower membership retention. Again, it is all about making the member feel important and valued.</p>

<h2 id=""engagement"">Develop your Business Engagement Scoring</h2>

</div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Engagement scoring is simple; think of it as a report card for each of your members. A business must first determine the appropriate “grading” scale for specific actions a member may take, this information all factors into that individual’s final grade in order to help a business categorize its members.<br /><br />Majority of businesses have three categories; very engaged, moderately engaged, and not engaged. The main goal would be to move the “not engaged” members up to the “very engaged” level in order to also hopefully boost membership retention. <br /><br />After breaking up your members, reach out to those who are less engaged with ways they can get involved with your program. Whether this be educational videos, conference calls, surveys, make the recipient feel welcome in your community.</p>

<h2 id=""reinforce"">Stress the Benefits of their Membership</h2>

</div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the end of the day, the benefits of the membership are most likely the main reason they decided to partner with your association. By promoting recent offerings and stressing the fact that your organization is the only one able to provide these benefits, members are able to remember exactly why they joined in the first place. Not only does this help with simply knowing what is available to them, but it also keeps them engaged in the organization with a way that is specifically designed for its members. <br /><br />Unfortunately, perfect retention rates do not exist in any organization, especially for new members. You will always face members who simply do not respond to your membership retention strategies. However, by giving your members the opportunity to see the value in their membership, you have done the most you can do to retain their presence. <br /><br />After implementing these 8 membership retention strategies into your own business, you will be able to take your association to the next level within the business world. Expending so much time and money in order to generate enough lead to convert individuals into members, is only profitable if you are able to retain these members. Use these strategies to your advantage and focus on providing the best service possible to your members in order to increase first-year membership retention and expand your overall association.</p>
<h2 id=""events"">Run Attractive Events </h2>
<p>Running events are a great way to engage members as it's a great time to put them in situations they wouldn't normally be in had you not run an events. That sounds a bit obvious, but what we mean is, sometimes people need to be push or pulled into situations that force them to get engaged. It's not unlike members to get bored or lazy when it comes to communicating, engaging or otherwise begin a part of an organization, and an event with a juicy topic or setting can usually be just the thing to invigorate them again. </p>
<p>Events are also a great way to attract new members and get some networking going, and networking is going to be the reason a lot of members join organizations in the first place. You arent' pandering to their need to network either. You're helping the community by being the one point of reference for all future business, projects, and campaigns to come together and discuss pertinent issues. Regular events like this are a sure fire way to keep members renewing so they can continue attending your now exclusive events for opportunities.</p>
<h2 id=""perks"">Offer Perks &amp; Benefits</h2>
<p>Perks and Benefits, like incentives, are partnerships or deals that you make with outside parties that give perks or benefits to your members. Sometimes these require profit sharing, and if you're lucky, some good will arrangements as well. If you're like to reward, award, or otherwise give perks to certain levels of membership. </p>
<p>Maybe it's a discount at Starbucks, or access to certain facilities at club rooms. These perks provided are great ways to retain members, as they may find these perks a great cost-benefit to themselves to stay as a member, and since like your partnership didn't cost you anything, it's no skin off your back to provide it as well. </p>
<p>Giving away perks willy-nilly is nice and all, but it's a little dangerous to just let them loose all at once. You can combine these perks with your membership incentives that we discussed in the beginning of this article. By setting membership goals in a member's lifecycle at your organization, you can prepare perks and discounts as an award for reaching certain milestones. 1 year membership completed? Get a $100 Amazon gift card. New member? Enjoy 15% off every coffee at your local coffee joint. Refer a new member? Get your next renewal 50% off.</p>
<p>Talk to your local or digital peers, you might find yourself in a fruitful predicament that can only help to benefit everyone. </p>

<p>Your organization should be treating membership engagement as an ongoing activity so members are able to engage 24/7. <a href=""https://blog.higherlogic.com/2016/09/08/how-to-develop-a-long-term-member-engagement-strategy"">There needs to be a consistent effort from the organization</a> to be reaching out to their individual members in order to actively boost membership engagement. <br /><br />To do this, first, begin selecting your communication channels. All of your communication should not be coming from a single source. It should be coming from multiple platforms such as; email, social media posts, website updates online, and even physical mail. <br /><br />Make sure and measure success with regular analytics on what communication platforms are being looked at the most, choose to run the majority of the information through that channel.</p>

<p>With the digital age continuing to expand, we are in a world where there is almost<a href=""https://www.membersuite.com/blog/5-ways-to-improve-member-engagement-by-using-apps""> always an app for everything</a>. And if there isn't an app, there is most likely someone in the world developing an app at this very moment. Not only are apps popular, but they are becoming essential for organizations wanting to create engagement with their audience. With U.S. users spending up to five hours on their <a href=""https://flurrymobile.tumblr.com/post/157921590345/us-consumers-time-spent-on-mobile-crosses-5"">smartphone</a>, and 89% of that coming from apps, this creates the perfect opportunity for organizations to conveniently access their users at all times. <br /><br />Whether they be a member of the specific organization or not, people look to their phone for everything nowadays. And when they are not looking at their phone, your organization should have an app that allows for convenient access to the information you are trying to convey. <br /><br />By making a mobile app for your organization, this will not only create active membership engagement but it is necessary for the organization to grow. Check out this <a href=""https://guidebook.com/mobile-guides/enhancing-member-engagement-for-associations-with-mobile-apps/"">GuideBook</a> article for a list of some of the top features that will make your organizations app more successful!</p>

<p>As an organization, it is beneficial for both parties to communicate with the members and vice-versa. But, it is even more important that the members of the organization are given the opportunity to communicate with one another. They joined because of the values they share with each other and the overarching sense of belonging they wish to be a part of. You as an organization can help quicken this bond by having both an <a href=""https://forums.gaceonline.com/store/product/1-active-membership/"">active local and online community!</a><br /><br />For local groups, this is generally done by having regular in-person meetings. But, when it comes to national or international organizations with members from all around the world, it can get kind of hard. The majority of the communication process will be through forums by encouraging membership engagement and participating in shared content. But, when you do have an annual convention, make sure your event runs smoothly using our <a href=""https://www.eventbank.ru/platform/event-management"">Event Management Program</a>.

10165,"8 Types of Event Sponsorships that Bring Value","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Event sponsorship continues to be the backbone of many event organizations and is currently the <a href=""https://www.thebalancesmb.com/sponsorship-a-key-to-powerful-marketing-2295276"">fastest growing form of marketing</a> in the United States. When done strategically, event sponsors offer significant opportunities for both the sponsor and the organization itself, presenting crucial marketing tactics and support for the event. Before we get to the 8 event sponsorship types that we've drummed up, you may be wondering, what exactly categorizes as an event sponsorship?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An event sponsorship allows sponsors to give some sort of investment in exchange for marketing at an event. When a pairing between event and sponsor is done correctly, it is a great way to spread the word of an organization without having to actually go through the trouble of planning the event themselves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, event sponsorship allows organizations to host bigger and better events at a lower cost! <br /><br />It’s a win-win for both parties. </p>

<h2 id=""top"">Financial Event Sponsorship</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":10166,""align"":""center"",""width"":692,""height"":470} -->
<div class=""wp-block-image"">

</div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Financial, or sometimes referred to as cash sponsors continue to be the leading type of event sponsorship. As the title suggests, financial event sponsors give money to an event organizer in exchange for promotions or other benefits outlined in their sponsorship agreement. <br /><br />For larger scaled events, you can create individual sponsorship packages for those who agree to contribute to your organization. <a href=""https://www.thefundraisingauthority.com/fundraising-events/set-event-sponsor-levels/"">The Fundraising Authority</a> has an article on how to set different sponsorship levels and the benefits they should be receiving for the amount raised. We found this to be an awesome article with many different perspectives and organization levels that could be helpful for any size organization!</p>

<h2>In-Kind Sponsors</h2>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In-Kind sponsors are comparable to financial sponsorships except they agree to provide goods or services instead of physical currency. The only difference between In-Kind sponsors and financial sponsors is the form in which they are contributing value to the event. Some examples of In-Kind sponsorships would be:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Venue Partners</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>According to <a href=""https://www.iaee.com/resources/decision-to-attend-study/"">IAEE</a>, 72% of event attendees say that the location of an event is a significant factor in deciding whether or not they will want to attend an event. Although planning the event will have a large part in the events success, you want to make sure your destination accurately depicts your organizations brand and caters to the correct audience.</li>
<li>Having the right venue partner is a huge advantage when it comes to the overall success of the event. Venue partners will allow organizations to host events at their venue in exchange for either a discounted or completely free rate. Not only does this type of event sponsorship allow for the venue to gain exposure, but it also gives the organization a great location to host their event!</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Prize Sponsors</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Just as the name suggests, prize sponsors are those who choose to donate specific items for event participants. Usually, with the company's logo on the items, prize sponsors are especially popular when wanting to boost the amount of engagement at an event. These items may be handed out as activity-based prizes for those who answer a question correctly, volunteer themselves as willing to participate in an activity, etc.</li>
<li>You as an organization are able to customize prize-related sponsors to fit within your own organization. For example, if you are a local gym membership-based organization, you could see if your prize sponsors want to donate customized weights or various other forms of gym equipment with their logo on it. It keeps your attendees happy while also promoting the sponsor for the event.</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Food Sponsors</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Let's be honest, an event isn't complete without readily available food. Even the free samples at Cosco attract hundreds of people a day. But, what's better than food?</li>
<li>Free food. Because of this, it is extremely important to try to find a food sponsor for your next big event. Catering an event can be extremely expensive, having a food sponsor will not only cut down on personnel costs but it also attracts individuals who may just be going to the event for the food. We've all been there.</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Digital Sponsors</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Popular for tech-related events are digital sponsors. These sponsors usually provide either an app for the event, the opportunity to supply poll questions, media walls, live tweets, etc. With the recent switch in technology, digital sponsors are becoming increasingly popular in the event planning industry.</li>
<li>People enjoy fast response times and personalization, add a digital sponsor to your event to make your attendees feel that much more special! Event Venues can benefit from digital sponsors as there's a growing trend in <a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/event-spaces-going-digital/"">digital event spaces</a> popping up across the globe's most tech-driven cities.</li>
</ul>

<p>In-Kind sponsorships are not limited to these four examples, in fact they can be anything the sponsor and organization agree on that is worth some sort of set value to the organization and the sponsor themselves! In fact, check out this awesome article by <a href=""https://grantspace.org/resources/blog/tips-for-finding-in-kind-sponsorships/"">GrantSpace</a> which goes into detail on the perfect tips and tricks for finding the right in-kind sponsor for your organization!</p>

<h2>Media Event Sponsorship</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rise of smartphone usage continues to evolve both our global and localized forms of direct marketing. The technological advancements and rise of the usage of these products contribute to the recent shift in appeal of media sponsorships. <a href=""https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recommended/tech/best-smartphones/"">Ofcom</a> compiled a report on the rise of smartphones which are now used by 78% of the population, compared to just 17% in 2008. Because of this surge in the use of media platforms, companies have chosen to opt for more convenient ways to advertise their events through media sponsorships.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":10169,""align"":""center""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter""><img class=""wp-image-10169"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-41.png"" alt=""Using the media to promote your events"" /></figure>
</div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Media sponsors are like financial sponsors but, they secure frequent advertising for the event on multiple communication platforms. This type of sponsorship is especially valuable for nonprofit/small businesses, considering some of the budgetary constraints that nonprofit organizations and events tend to face. Having readily available media sponsors are key exposure tactics for advertisement and publicity purposes of smaller companies. <br /><br />When media sponsors are present, the organization spends less time and money on the advertisements themselves, and do not face the difficulty of purchasing the media coverage they often require. Although learning about media sponsorship is one thing, finding the right media sponsor for your organization is key when determining the success of this partnership. <a href=""https://smallbusiness.chron.com/create-media-sponsor-package-nonprofits-14510.html"">Chron</a> has a great article on how to find and create the perfect media sponsor package for your next event! <br /><br />Want to be your own media sponsor? Check out <a href=""https://www.eventbank.com/platform/crm-business"">EventBank's</a> CRM software that allows you to keep all contact information and activity tracking up to date and in a single location.

<h2>Promotional Partners</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":10167,""align"":""center""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter""><img class=""wp-image-10167"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-39.png"" alt=""event promotion partnerships and sponsorships"" /></figure>
</div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Compared to media sponsors, promotional partners are individual people who may have a large following on social media and are able to promote your organization's event to their individual fan base. Instagram has become an extremely popular approach for brands to promote their products through those with larger followings. <br /><br />An article from Influence Central even found that <a href=""https://influence-central.com/social-upends-traditional-media-in-driving-shopping-purchases/"">81% of consumers</a> say they're more likely to buy products they have encountered while on social media. This statistic in combination with the recent influx of smartphones makes promotional partners vital when advertising for any event. <br /><br />When it comes down to it, any kind of event sponsorship will be crucial if your organization wants to continue growing and promoting their business. Not only does it allow your organization to reach out to other companies and create lasting connections, but it provides positives for both the sponsor and the recipient.</p>

<h2><br />Is Event Tech really that big of a deal?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A lot more than you realize. <br /><br />Events are becoming the go-to engagement point for a lot of companies and organizations, and the ROI involved is palpable. At EventBank we've drilled into event ROI and its relationship to technology, the correlation is a powerful one. The larger events get, the more content is needed, and the intensity of ROI is not just the number of bodies in an event space, but the engagement that can come from an event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's also entirely dependent on the type of goal an event has. Is it ticket sales? Product sales? Intangible marketing value? <br /><br />Event Tech steps in as a way to take the headache away from the processes needed to make these goals attainable. Whether it be a basic ticketing system, to as precise as heat maps of event spaces for better body-traffic predictions and so on.<br /><br />Here's a list of Event Tech types to help give you an idea of the wide range of tech that's out there, it's function, and more.</p>

<h3>1. Attendee-to-Attendee Chat</h3>
<p><img class=""notfull aligncenter wp-image-16674 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/attendee-to-attendee-chat-eventbank@2x-909x1024.png"" alt="""" width=""909"" height=""1024"" /></p>
<p>Attendee Chat is a new tool being used at events across the world, particularly for large events with over 500 attendees, and there's just no possible way to physically meet everyone during the entirety of events. With the adoption of smartphones as an every-day use item in the pockets of all of your event-goers, then you're likely going to benefit from attendee-to-attendee chat. </p>
<p>What does it do? </p>
<p>Well, if it wasn't obvious, it's meant to let attendees chat with one another, like a messenger that's specifically for your event and only for those who are registered for it. This helps attendees find and chat with one another at an event without having them meet each other in person. This is also super helpful if you want to drive networking and buzz both before, during, and/or after your event too so attendees can stay in touch, or plan meet-ups prior to events.</p>
<p>However, this does cause a bit of a pandora's box situation. If you allow everyone to find each other in an event with potentially thousands of attendees, people might get bombarded and easily annoyed by conversations coming to their phones. Especially VIPs. </p>
<p>It's very particular that when choosing a provider, they give ample tools to limit or regulate the chatting experience. That means maybe allowing only 5-10 conversations at one time per users, forcing them to delete current conversations should they want to reach out to other event goers. This should help bring down individuals spamming other attendees. There are other things that can help alleviate chat headaches in the future like having VIP only chat, the ability to hide yourself from the chat network, and so on. </p>
<p>It's a game-changing new technology but it must be implemented holistically or else you might end up upsetting and annoying your attendees instead. </p>

<p>This one is a quite straight forward tool. It's simply a marketplace or database of event spaces available for rent for a wide variety of events. These types of tools help event organizers choose event venues in the early stages, and their true value that comes from the marketplace is the in-depth details related to events that call out to event planners and the ability to get venues and events to mingle together. <br /><br />But did you know that event venues can be projected across the globe?

<p>Obviously event registration is the most attendee intensive part of any tech implementation in an event, and it's becoming more involved with mobile phones over time, making the process of checking in smoother. Adoption of mobile-first check-ins are a bit slow but ever-growing in the west, while Asia has all but fully adopted the method of QR-code ticket scans to check in at events. The tech is green, easy to use, and highly pliable to different ticket types. This also allows for a smoother online-offline attendee journey tracking.</p>

<p>Event promotion and email marketing are equally as important to the run-up of the event as it is to the post-event, so it's no surprise that email marketing tools are gracing the desktops of many event managers and organizers. Attractive emails are one thing, but smart emails are another, and it's through smarter email campaigns that can be automated and generated based on the event details save time, target audiences better, and overall make give the digital life of the event a whole new meaning. <br /><br />While MailChimp and other great email marketing tools do exist, you'll be hard pressed to find them created with the expressive intent of targeting event goers and organizers. And yes, while a beautifully created email campaign works to get customers through the door, it's incredibly difficult to make and it takes time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Normally, an email campaign would take time and preparation before sending out, but events are hard-hitting, and frequent reminders, invitations, and follow-ups that require a lot of auto-generation and automation to make them effective. <br /><br />Auto-generation comes from the tool's ability to understand what's going on in the event, the content used, and to re-create it into a beautifully professional email that's sure to convert target audiences into attendee audiences. <br /><br />This is a rare product on the market and fortunately, at EventBank we're one of the few who do endeavor to make this email marketing leap with our event management platform. By natively integrating our event management module to the email marketing tool, you'll be able to generate professional and beautiful looking EDMs with just a few clicks and very little work from your end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The tool simply takes what's already been used in the event's web page and generates an email with it. Invite speakers, attendees, press, or follow up to attendees who were there, or not there for further marketing value.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Event website builders are simply drag &amp; drop website builders that are specifically for events. Whenever you imagine yourself needing a landing page for your event, it can tend to be a pain. <br /><br />Event pages need to be like a blog, easily created, and always updating and kept up to date. That means the page needs to be flexible enough to look good while still compiling your events into one place, as well as collecting all the event landing pages in an easily searchable home page area. <br /><br />Your event's digital lifespan will exist in this portion of your event strategy, and it's the place where online registrations take place, so it's an extremely important area of event management that needs to be both attractive and functional. There's a lot of choices out there, but as most event planners are not web developers, it's best to find a drag &amp; drop solution that helps you build a website in minutes with great templates.<br /><br />We even have a comparison of some tools here. <a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/best-event-management-software/""><strong>Check it out! </strong></a></p>

<h3 id=""polls"">6. Live Surveys and Polls</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Live survey and polls are a great way to get large audiences engages who would have otherwise not had a voice in the discussion on stage. There are a few niche providers for this function, like <a href=""https://www.sli.do/"">sli.do</a>, but it's a growing demand as it lets the lifespan of speakers on stage extend beyond prepared statements and will essentially become its own event type. Audiences will be able to interact with questions asked by speakers, and it's through this that events can take on a new life. <br /><br />The issue involved is encouraging attendees to take a controlled from the event to make their answers known in real time. Like a clicker that tracks their answers in A,B,C,D style multiple choice answers. Alternatively, a smartphone app can be used but that's seemingly more difficult than handing an attendee a remote, as it's tough to track down all attendees and encourage them to download an app on their phone in the run-up, or during the event.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>networking platforms are simply communities that are based online. Imagine if your audience has separate interests, even if your event has a topic they're all interested in. Industries, communities, and other interest groups could converge and communicate in their own networking platforms so they can make the most value of their event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This networking type platform makes it easier as well for networking individuals to get in contact with another attendee or speaker without taking their time from the event or if they're otherwise too busy to meet attendees in the crowd. <br /><br />That platforms give people as well an opportunity to grab contact info without breaking up meaningful conversations being had at an event, leaving less business developers entering the space and ruining the mood.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Analytics is the butter to the bread of any decent software out there. Without analytics you’ll walk blinding from event to event, never knowing the true value of your past experiences, insights into attendee behavior or even accurate ROI tracking.</p>
<p><br />Analytics platforms like Google Analytics can only really track the digital experience of your event’s web page. But it’s the value on the event floor that also needs to be taken into consideration. Google Analytics would not be able to tell you that a registrant checked in at the event. So, event software like registration, check-in, or all-in-one event management software would help you understand who’s checked in. <br /><br />Likewise, that same check-in software you opt for will find it tough to track backwards into who, and then where and how that attendee interacted with your event. There are some CRM integrations at play here, but few will take the whole bite of the cookie and look at the entire pipeline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All-in-one event management software is the best option around, as this leaves the ability to track the attendee pipeline from entry to post-event actions. For instance, you can now track where attendees discover your event online, whether they registered online, and then track from their online actions to their offline actions at the event.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most disciplines of business revolve around one thing. The Buyer’s Journey. <br /><br />In events, it’s now The Attendee Journey.<br /><br />Understanding the full lifecycle of the attendee’s experience at a given event is now the most valuable asset to frequent, serial, or large annual/biannual events. It’s through the attendee journey that we’re able to understand the right channels, language, and offers that get maximum foot traffic through the doors of future events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No matter the goal of the event, knowledge of that entire experience and actions an attendee has taken has been quite useful in assuming demand and interests among audiences. <br /><br />Without a doubt, the journey begins long before the event takes place and it’s important to be able to track this online to offline (and likely back to online) activity. Most events will see registrations take place online, and at the front door, but another missing piece is the follow-up marketing and engagement that’s far more critical after the event, rather than before.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having had attendees experience the event, it’s an indicator that they’re already as engaged as can be, and whatever your goal of the event is, now is the time to target these audience members as soon as the event is over. Only then can the journey be complete.</p>
<p>Event Data is a growing demand among event managers, and without a doubt, it has its own host of <a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/challenges-event-organizers-planning-events/"">challenges</a>. Here is a bit of neat stats about the challenges that event managers are facing when it comes to event data and managing that data so that it incentivizes growth. </p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Events are more than just the audience and activities at a physical place. Your event audience is still just as digital as it is physical, and that means making events revolve around both the physical and the digital. Calls to actions within the event space should harken to online actions like promoting and sharing the event with friends and other types of engagement CTAs. <br /><br />This also leaves room for live streaming and media outlets to be let into the event space to report and showcase the event. It’s a great way to magnify your event to a larger audience, especially if it’s a widely international one. It’s getting more commonplace and affordable to get media partners to promote and showcase the event as it’s taking place, allowing those who could not be there to enjoy the event reporting as it goes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As well post-event content is extremely necessary to extend the longevity of the event’s value to those who were both on the event floor or not.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Event heatmaps have been a growing trend among larger events who can’t adequately analyze event floor foot traffic. By having properly mapped event floors or even better, 3D model, sensors and IR cameras in the rafters of event spaces collect and track heat signatures among the crowd over time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By interlacing this heatmap data over a rendered or 3D model of the Event Space, it can become clear to event organizers what’s been going on at the event in terms of attendee foot traffic and interests. With this data, it’s easy to know where pain points are in the audience, where it might be overcrowded due to bad organization, or maybe there was a particularly interesting booth that caught audience’s eyes.</p>

<p>Virtual reality is a growing trend among the entertainment industry and so very obviously it’s been a more visible function of some entertainment events. VR, however, has proven to be more functional than just an entertainment console, as its function in a lot of fields has proven to be quite useful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s also a great way to attract attendees who want to see tech being leveraged at the event space and experience VR for themselves. It leaves a lasting impact on the attendee’s experience and it definitely draws a crowd.

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While privacy matters have taken a hold on some regions of the world, facial recognition is still an in-demand asset for events in others. Holding onto printouts, tickets, QR codes, and even the pain of downloading an app are tall requests to ask of an audience who simply wants to not wait in line to get into an event. Facial recognition is a great way to check in attendees, verify them, and all without requiring action taken by the registrant. <br /><br />The privacy debate is still hotly contested in most western countries where it’s at the forefront of techno-sociology, however in areas like Singapore, China, and other more tech-progressive nations privacy is oftentimes secondary to technology progression, and Facial recognition is certainly not an issue for locals to enjoy a smoother check-in at events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Without a doubt, this is one technology that will affect more than just events, but it’s also an inevitable piece of technology we will encounter at the check-in of future events to come.</p>

<h2><strong>Now Back to You</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Event Tech is more than just terminology for simply having tech in an event. It’s a growing cause to make events as engaging and successful as they can be by leveraging new technology to do it. Events are one of the few times that online-offline activities meld together for the same purpose, and without technology to bring that gap closer, events could potentially stay in the dark ages. <br /><br />If you’re looking to leverage tech that’s going to help with your event, here’s some tips when shopping around:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Don’t dive too deep, tech gets invented and released to market faster and faster these days, so don’t take a risk on iffy products. Stay humbly tech-enthusiastic and use what’s currently working at other events to catch up, and then fill in the gaps with other tech.</li>
<li>Create a full journey with tech and automation in mind. Without automating engagement, a 5000 person event can only hope to reach out to a few hundred in the post-event marketing campaign.</li>
<li>Book demos. Event Tech is majority SaaS model products and that means you’re likely to get demos and free trial offers that can benefit your next event. This will give you time to experience it for yourself before you decide to buy.</li>
<li>If traditional methods work better than the technological alternative, then use the traditional method. Sometimes audiences don’t respond well to new things, and if you notice that event tech is harming your audience’s experience, then it’s actually best to stay traditional in some areas. For instance, if audiences are reluctant to download a check-in app for the event, and that means moving them from one line to another at check-in, then it’s probably just best to save the app check-in line and just make it 2 name-list check-in lines and move people through faster.</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>EventBank is clearly a move in the direction of Event Tech being a more familiar product like Salesforce, MailChimp, and all the other great tools combined into one. Without automation and integrations like this, there’s likely going to be continued headaches for management at events as audiences inevitably crave more engagement.</p>

在实施自动化营销程序前，创建一个工作流十分重要。这个工作流有助于企业的营销团队为新活动做准备，还可确保自动化所产生的收益对品牌来说价值最佳。以下是5个关键步骤：

<strong>1</strong><strong>、确定需要实现自动化的工作任务</strong>

团队里重复性最多的营销工作是最需要实现自动化的，企业也将因此受益。如上文提到的，如简单的自动化邮件回复，可帮助企业大大减少管理负担。只需列出当前的各项营销工作，并挑选最耗时且最需要实现自动化的工作任务。

<strong>2</strong><strong>、选择最合适的自动化软件</strong>

说起自动化软件，选择可就多了。但选出最佳的一款软件，对于刚开始了解自动化的企业来说着实困难。今天，我们将在本文中介绍出色又好用的自动化软件。需要指出的是，针对不同的行业，也可能会有不同的定制软件供使用。在确定长期使用某一款软件前，企业十分有必要对该软件进行深入的调查分析。并评估该款软件是否是最佳选择。

<strong>3、对营销团队的培训</strong>

虽说自动化可迅速提高营销效率，但新软件和流程的引入需要企业在员工培训上投入成本。对团队成员而言，了解自动化如何解决工作中的痛点，以及重新定位自己的工作重心，是十分重要的。强调软件优势，并让员工全面地测试软件系统，同时知晓任何可能的问题。预计营销自动化将成为最重要的营销技能之一，企业也正在适应这种趋势，并于此进行投资。

<p>营销方向是否正确？ <br>上半年的营销推广是否真正促进销售？   <br>如何制定下半年的营销策略？  <br>……  <br>等等问题在年中更值得复盘和再思考。 </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>在IBM商业价值研究院发布的一篇有关CMO的调研报告中显示，<strong>有84%的受访CMO正担心自己的营销推广因为营销趋势的更新而改变。</strong>而从去年开始，蔓延开来的“经济寒冬”更是压缩了CMO在其中的生存空间。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>然而挑战与机遇并存。市场动态复杂、客户喜好变化多端，需要更先进的营销方式去适应企业不断变化的需求。CMO如果能够在新的环境中抓住时下市场营销趋势——<strong>不仅能够帮助企业完成更成功的营销目标，也会迎来自己职业生涯的高光时刻。</strong><br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>本文精选了<strong>8个CMO必须知道的营销趋势</strong>，拓展你的生存空间。<br></p>

<h2><strong>敏捷营销：营销迭代呼唤复合型人才</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>敏捷（Agile）</strong>近年来在营销界被提及的越来越多，人人都在说敏捷营销是“市场营销的下一件大事”，国外也有成功应用敏捷营销将生产力提升400%的例子。（点击这里获取敏捷营销案例）<br><br>麦肯锡数字营销业务合伙人兼全球主管Jason Heller表示，下一轮营销转型很可能是迈向“敏捷”的一步。都9102年了，如果你还不了解敏捷营销的话，一定要在这篇文章中详细了解一下。<br><br>“敏捷营销”的概念由“敏捷开发”发展而来。仔细研究2012年在旧金山发布的《敏捷营销宣言》就会发现，营销领域的方法论与开发领域确实有共通之处。<br><br>敏捷营销宣言的主要原则：</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>经过验证的知识，而不是观点和约定俗成</li><li>以顾客为中心的协作，而不是“孤岛”和“层级”</li><li>适应和迭代，而不是爆炸性的广告活动</li><li>有一套流程来寻找客户，而不是静态预测</li><li>灵活，而不是死板的计划</li><li>响应变革，而不是跟随计划</li><li>多次小规模试验，而不是豪赌</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>知名咨询公司Gartner对803名CMO的调查发现，89％的CMO表示他们的公司正在试图采用某种形式的‘敏捷’营销。然而，今天只有21％的公司采用完全敏捷的营销方法。如果这个数据放在中国的市场营销部门，应该会更低。<br><br>那么如何将敏捷营销成功地运用在自己的流程搭建和管控中，又如何运用敏捷营销对市场推广活动进行更快地验证和迭代呢？离不开两个核心的话题<strong>“迭代”和“协作”</strong>。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>在敏捷营销中，对CMO新的要求就是：需要结合企业自身的条件和特点，快速调整营销策略，动态地设计相应的营销组织结构，合理配置营销资源，同时能够在快速变化的环境下帮助团队协作和成长。</p>

<h2><strong>回归本源：市场功能下沉，营销本应看得更深</strong><br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>作为市场营销人，每天都在进行市场营销活动的实操，但你有没有静下心来想一想——<strong>营销的本质是什么？</strong><br><br>对于这个问题，就像一千个人有一千个哈姆雷特一样，每一个营销人都有自己的见解，CMO更是有着自己独特的感悟。然而从营销诞生之初，<strong>著</strong><strong>名营销之父科特勒则认为：营销是有能力满足消费者需求，并且能持续获得利润。</strong><br><br>随着营销行业的发展，需求的分散和职能不同，让营销人对“成功营销”的评判有着不同的标准。“围绕客户去获得利润”曾被认为是创业公司的需求。然而最近一段时间，越来越多的大公司也重新回归了“通过营销获取客户，从而获得利润”的营销目的。<br><br>Deloitte全球首席营销官Diana O'Brien表示，2019年将是“回归营销基础”的好年景，这意味着将“客户放在组织的中心”在市场营销工作中的重要性的回归 。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>基于此，O'Brien提出了<strong>四个M（心态mindset，时刻moment，行动moves和意义meaning）</strong>，这四个M的结合将为企业和CMO的发展带来全球化的提升，结果也导向“促成销售”的最终目的。<br></p>

<h2><strong>新客户体验时代：CXM并不只是一个新词</strong><br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>从1999年中国引入CRM客户关系管理概念至今，CRM已经历了十多年的发展。从最早记录客户信息，到形成与客户跟单信息相关的一些事务性的工作记录系统，再到现在智能化的、与协同管理紧密结合的企业运营性系统，CRM也成为市场营销领域广泛应用的手段。随后许多提供B端服务的企业也重视起了CSM客户成功管理，而诞生时间更短的<strong>CXM客户体验管理也在最近受到更多营销人的关注。</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>事实上，CXM并不只是一个新鲜词汇。在发展更先一步的国际市场中，CXM具有更前瞻的意义。<br><br>Adobe营销战略和通讯部的副总裁Stacy Martinet表示，下一轮数字化转型将专注于CXM。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>想要提供真正具有变革性客户体验的公司，需要实现实时地智能预测客户数据，”她说。“在2019年，我们将看到企业专注于建立无缝连接的客户数据 - 行为、交易、财务、运营等——以获得真正的点到点客户视图，以便立即采取行动。”<br><br>这和敏捷营销的模式相贯通，通过对客户行为数据的精细化收集来实现。相比于为客户提供更优质的产品或服务体验，市场营销人更应该关注<strong>如何引导客户体验自己的产品和服务中令客户惊喜和有效的部分。</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>EventBank捷会易的CRM客户管理模块就具有对客户体验升级趋势及时响应的更优功能。除了实现传统CRM系统的数据集管理外，EventBank捷会易的CRM模块还提供对单个客户的互动行为的精准且实时的追踪和分析。数据中包含客户对企业的营销活动的参与度、营销邮件的打开情况以及付费意愿等具体体验的分项收集，通过标准化的的平台和精细化的分析帮助营销和销售人员制定富有洞察力的营销决策。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>数据驱动创造力：营销需要“全脑人才”</strong><br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>创意曾是营销人引以为傲的核心技能，然而数字时代的到来让数据对创意的驱动作用越来越强烈。<br><br>麦肯锡的研究发现，许多希望整合数据和创造力的公司正在寻找并雇佣左脑和右脑都非常发达的<strong>“全脑人才”</strong>。换句话说，2019年可能是有利于数据驱动创意发展的一年。在创意上运用数据驱动的方法有助于营销人员高效地工作，能更快地创造出合适的内容，并将这些内容通过正确的渠道，在合适的时间发送给客户。<br><br><strong>“全脑人才”的重要性提升，有技术背景的CMO会更获得企业的青睐。</strong>而没有技术背景的CMO们也不必焦虑，因为技术应该是营销战略中的助推器，而非营销本身。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>而那些专注于客户和创意的CMO们在接下来的数字浪潮中，应该将注意力分出一部分在营销技术的学习上，以求在跨部门的合作时进行有效的资源的整合，推动营销目标的成功。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>个性化营销升级：助力效果提升</strong><br></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>个性化是一个老生常谈的话题，但事实上营销领域的“个性化”还处于一个很基础的水平。个性化营销在2019年面临着进一步升级，由点对面（也就是对客户进行分类）的营销，进化为点对点的营销。<br><br>根据Evergage最新发布的《2019年个性化营销趋势报告》，受访者们认为个性化带来了这些好处：<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>提高转化率（61%）；</li><li>增加访客参与度（59%）；</li><li>改善客户体验（56%）；</li><li>增加潜在客户生成和获取新客户（56%）</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>在这项研究中，电子邮件作为个性化渠道被更多营销人员认可。<strong>近78%的营销人员在电子邮件营销中使用了个性化。</strong>尽管邮件营销还没有广泛应用在中国的营销领域中，但对<strong>出海企业</strong>或<strong>B端企业</strong>来说，客户对“邮件用来接收重要信息”的认知越来越强，邮件营销将在中国的营销行业持续发力。<br><br>EventBank捷会易的邮件营销模块能够满足现代营销趋势的个性化需求。不仅能够通过专业设计的电子邮件模板自动化地向客户发送通知、传递信息，还提供详尽的邮件营销性能分析及报告，优化邮件营销效果。</p>

<h2><strong>ABM：B2B营销ROI新引擎</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>ABM（Account-Based Marketing）基于账户的营销是对B2B行业的营销人员及CMO来说更重要趋势。</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>B2B行业营销经常投入大量的时间和经历去挖掘潜在客户，而ABM是一个新思路——它需要营销人员针对已有客户（尤其是大客户）资源进行深度地挖掘和发展。它将营销和销售资源集中在市场中明确定义的一组目标帐户上，并采用旨在与每个帐户产生共鸣的个性化营销活动。<strong>根据Altera的一项调查显示，ABM的ROI比其他营销活动高出20%。</strong><br><br>ABM能够让营销人员充分利用现有的资源，在有针对性的个性化营销基础之上，提升ROI，并且达成可预测的营销目标。那么如何能够准确高效地将ABM运用到营销活动中呢？以下是6个要点：</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>发现并定义高价值客户</li><li>确定客户账户并识别决策方式和决策者</li><li>制定个性化内容</li><li>确定最佳渠道</li><li>执行有针对性的活动</li><li>测试、复盘和优化</li></ul>

<h2><strong>打造个人品牌：双倍提升影响力</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>前文提到了很多新趋势，下面要介绍一个“老面孔”——个人品牌。<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>个人品牌对企业品牌的提升作用早已得到很多CMO的认可，在新的营销环境中，这个方式依然奏效。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>知名营销人也是明星企业的领导者Vaynerchuk认为“没有什么比分享你的个人想法更重要了，在LinkedIn上以博客的形式展示企业，对打造个人品牌绝对有效。”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>关于这一点，畅销十年的《走红：如何打造个人品牌》一书中就有详尽的实操建议。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>MarTech</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>在IBM发布的2019年营销趋势中，MarTech占有重要的位置。他们甚至将MarTech＋AdTech的组合喻为<strong>“营销圣杯”</strong>。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>MarTech被讨论多年。行至2019年，这样的趋势正渐渐转变为营销人尤其是CMO的必备技能。而<strong>营销自动化工具</strong>正是帮助CMO们掌握和发挥这项技能的重要手段。<br><br>在以往的文章中我们总结了<strong>6款2019年全球CMO必备的营销自动化工具</strong>，可以在我们的Blog中查看。<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>结语</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>蓬勃发展的行业不会等待个人缓慢的成长，只有抓住行业发展的核心趋势才能在企业和个人的发展道路上立于不败之地。</p>

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-10181 size-full"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/eventplanningproblems-blog@2x-1.png"" alt=""Event Organizing Challenges"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

<h2>Special Event Promotion Blog Post Series</h2>
Blogs continue to be a growing marketing tactic for many companies in the business industry and is used to both generate sales and boost conversion leads. The easy access to people from all over the world makes relaying information to the consumers especially easy and provides a sense of entertainment to the readers. Unlike social media, blog posts are a formal way to provide communication between you and your targeted audience in contrast to manufactured marketing techniques provided through social media.

By creating interesting and unique content for your next event, this propels the amount of sharing opportunities for your intended audience. Blog posts are one of the most cost-effective event promotional techniques with also high return for your organization. The use of viral marketing encourages word of mouth and the sharing of your event. To enhance the easy ability to share blog posts for your readers, enable social sharing buttons so your followers can share the post on their favorite social media platforms! According to a study done by <a href=""https://seotribunal.com/blog/blogging-statistics/"">SEOTribunal</a>, companies who blog receive 97% more links to their website. Not only is this option cost-effective, but it also is a quick way to gain a larger audience!
<h2>Know Your SEO</h2>
Not only do blog posts create a more personalized vibe to marketing, but it also improves your SEO. SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization and is how often your posts show up on a search engine’s result list. With the use of regularly posted content through blog posts, your organization is generating a plethora of keywords that can put you higher on the result list when there is someone looking for related information.

Not only will knowing your company’s SEO improve your blog’s visibility, but this also generates additional traffic to your event website. Additional traffic means an increase in the awareness of your event and most likely a larger turnout.
<h2>Create A Customized Event Email Signature</h2>
Unlike a typical ID photo, email signatures contain all the important information of the sender within a simple singular block following the body of every email you send. These professional email signatures make your message personal with the easy visibility of your professional obligation.

But, what most people don’t tend to utilize is adding your organization's event promotion banner onto their personal email signature. This heightens the exposure of your organization's event with every email you send in order to drive registrations to your event.

The addition of these visual elements will attract the eyes of your recipient and act as an additional source of advertisement for whatever event your organization chooses to hold.
<h2>Attend Local Networking Events</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-265 size-full"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/networking-event-e1495422285915.jpg"" alt=""collecting photos after event"" width=""1024"" height=""481"" />

Attending networking events grows your organization's overall network and connections to other companies/individual people. The growth of both your organization and your network will contribute to the number of people you personally choose to invite to the event.

Not only will attending these events grow your network, but they will also develop your communication skills with other people in the business industry. By learning how to connect with people outside of your initial circle, you’re sure to have more people to attend your organization's event, even if it was just for personal support
<h2>Corporate Event Sponsorship</h2>
Like we discussed in <a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/event-sponsorship-types/"">8 Types of Event Sponsorships that Attendees Love</a>, having an event sponsor is an easy way to draw additional people to your event. Your organization's increase in variability of marketing techniques increases your credible reputation as an organization that continues to attract more people from your target market.

When event sponsorship is done well, it not only shows support for the event but is an easy way to attract more attendees who might not have known about your event beforehand.
<h2>Sponsor an Event Booth</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1064 size-full"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_1924.jpg"" alt=""event planning"" width=""1620"" height=""1080"" />

Sponsoring a booth at an event with similar attendees enables your organization to increase their event visibility and your overall brand awareness. By using eye-catching displays at an event booth and professionally produced marketing tactics, your organization can attract more people to your booth.

An easy way to not only get a lot of leads but, also draw people to your booth would be to encourage people to drop off their business card in a bucket for a chance to win a prize. Or you could ask people to follow your organization on social media that would enable you to receive their contact information. <a href=""https://info.zimmercommunications.com/blog/15-marketing-benefits-to-an-event-booth-sponsorship"">Zimmer Radio &amp; Marketing Group</a> has an informational article full of additional ideas to make your next event booth stand out.
<h2>Mystery QR Code</h2>
With recent technological advances, it is important to give people easy access to seeing a promotion for an event through their mobile devices. This easy access and automatic notification reminders for the event, allow for QR codes to be the easiest way to not only remind someone of an upcoming event but, also draw the attention of additional attendees.

Try also handing out prizes for people that are willing to scan your QR code!
<h2>Event Promotional Hashtags</h2>
Event promotion begins with increased engagement and attention towards your event. An easy way to do this would be to create a unique event hashtag! People are constantly refreshing their social media pages nowadays and sharing their pictures/videos. Hashtags make finding a post that much easier because when you click on the hashtag, users and businesses can quickly see all of the post associated with this tag.

Prizes can also be handed out to lucky winners who choose to post content using your organization's special tag. Having trouble creating the perfect hashtag for your next big event? <a href=""https://thrivehive.com/creating-a-hashtag-for-an-event/"">ThriveHive</a> has a step-by-step guide on creating the perfect hashtag that will be sure to boost your engagement before, during, and after the event.
<h2>Countdown to Event</h2>
Countdowns on your organization's social media pages lead to higher engagement when it comes to your ability to promote a future event. The possibilities of the amount of promotion an event can receive using a countdown clock are endless and is a completely free way to incorporate a new marketing technique into your campaign.

Not only does the countdown clock serve as a reminder to your attendees when an event is happening, it gets your viewers excited and ready for the upcoming event. Here’s an article on some of the <a href=""https://www.idownloadblog.com/2018/08/29/best-countdown-apps-iphone-ipad/"">best countdown applications</a> your organization can easily use!
<h2>Re-share Your Attendee's Content</h2>
What’s the point of creating a hashtag for an event if your organization is not going to repost your supporters content? Show your followers that other people are also actively participating in this activity by re-sharing content picked out by your social media team that they believe best represents your organization.

Everyone enjoys being in the spotlight at one capacity or another, if their content is re-shared enter them in a drawing to win a prize at the event!
<h2>Event Promotion Instagram Highlight Reel</h2>
Creating an Instagram highlight reel is a great option to promote both past and future events. Highlight reels can contain both photos and videos, giving your organization the perfect opportunity to convey the energy and excitement of past events, in hopes that they will want to be a part of future events. It is also a great tool to easily re-share member content and positive experiences with your organization.
<h2>Ticket Giveaways</h2>
We've said it once and we'll say it again, everyone loves free stuff. No matter or not if they actually have a use for the free items, the thrill of receiving it instantly associates a positive connotation with your organization. Ticket giveaways are the perfect prize that will have everyone wanting to enter the competition.

Even try posting the giveaway on your instagram highlight reel, having people post pictures/stories tagging your organization and hashtag for a chance to enter!
<h2>Donate a Portion of the Tickets to Charity</h2>
Even better than ticket giveaways, opt to donate a portion of the ticket prices to a charity that resonates with your organization. This will not only be a positive outlook for your organization but, people will be more likely to purchase additional tickets if they know a portion of the tickets is going to a good cause.
<h2>Switch to Tiered Pricing</h2>
Offering a distinct range of differently priced tickets after you have figured out how much people are willing to pay, ensures that people will be able to pay the minimum for your event and those that want to splurge more are able to get certain perks your organization can offer for differently priced tickets.

<h2>Try Facebook Geomarketing</h2>
As stated before, Facebook continues to be a top social media platform when it comes to event promotion. Facebook geomarketing in particular, targets people who may be interested in your event based on lead ads or by targeting existing customers of a business related to your own. This type of marketing shows an advertisement to relevant individuals that, based on their search history, would be interested in the event. Check out this article by <a href=""https://adespresso.com/blog/geo-targeting-facebook-ads/"">AdEspresso</a> to see if Facebook geomarketing would be a good fit for your organization!
<h2>Designated Tweeter</h2>
Sticking with the theme of social media, Twitter also continues to be a growing platform that organizations are choosing to use to promote their future events. <a href=""https://blog.bizzabo.com/tips-for-twitter-event-promotion"">Studies</a> show that 36% of Americans between the ages of 18-29 use Twitter, in addition to the 22% of Americans between the ages of 30-49. This makes Twitter the perfect place where young professionals are continuing to consume and share news on a single platform.

Having a “designated tweeter” will help you stay in the forefront of an upcoming event and continue to draw more attention to your organization. Like we talked about in the beginning of the article with special hashtags, your organization can also use these hashtags on twitter! Re-share the tweets that are tagged in the hashtag in real-time at your own event!
<h2>Direct Mail</h2>
Direct mail is perfect for event promotion when you want to personalize your marketing events to your potential attendees. Your recipients will think an actual direct mail invitation is special and exciting compared to sending out a generic email.

Aside from the personalization aspect of it, there is a special “fun factor” and multiple creative options you can use when choosing to decorate a direct mail invitation.
<h2>Event Promotion Video</h2>
According to <a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/Home/404Page"">Forrester Research</a>, a video is 600% more effective than a printed ad. Event promotion videos enable a personal connection between the viewer and the organization and are the next best thing compared to a face-to-face meeting with the group of individuals.

With the use of inexpensive video equipment your organization, big or small, can see the value of recording a promotional video for your upcoming event.
<h2>Pre-Event Email Campaigns</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3292 size-full"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Email-Campaigns-Ad-Copy@2x.png"" alt=""event email marketing guide"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Although direct mail is perfect to invite people to an event, pre-event emails are easiest when quickly mentioning the event in their email list. Include your promotional video and a catchy subject line to make sure they open your email! We even show off <a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/event-email-marketing-strategies/"">10 awesome event email campaigns</a> that converted across the web!
<h2>Infographics</h2>
Don’t have enough funds for an event promotional video team? We suggest creating an infographic! Visual content is still crucial when creating a sense of engagement across your followers, and it stands out when in comparison to text promotion. Not only are infographics a fun and unique visual to explain an event, but it also provides the audience with key important information that makes it easy to understand.

We suggest beginning with some free online infographic maker options such as <a href=""https://www.visme.co/"">Visme</a>, <a href=""https://snappa.com/create/infographics"">Snappa</a>, and <a href=""https://www.canva.com/create/infographics/"">Canva</a>. These websites are extremely user-friendly and are sure to boost your events attendee list!
<h2>Local Grafitti</h2>
In our technology-driven world, grabbing the attention of individuals is key when wanting to market an event. Partner up with a local street artist and create a mural for your organization itself/upcoming event!

When planning this spontaneous event, timing and location will be key in order to attract the most viewers. Also, the artwork itself should be pleasing to the ordinary eye in hopes locals will take a picture with the mural and even use your event hashtag as a social media post!

You should probably get the right permits to do it though!
<h2>Pop-Up Photo Booth</h2>
Photo booths act as a unique and decently cost-effective way for extreme event promotion. Technology is taking over the industry now, but people still love the tangible photos you receive from a photo booth.

Put your event cover photo on the bottom of the printed out pictures to inform people of your organization's upcoming event. Have them even post a picture of the photo reel with your event hashtag in order to be entered in a contest to win some freebies!
<h2>Henna Stall</h2>
Although not the traditional form of event promotion, Henna stalls can be a great way to spread the word of an upcoming event. Try opening up a pop-up Henna stall about a week before an event. While they are receiving the henna, hand out details to your event and, if they show up with their Henna tattoo they will receive free prizes and discounts!

This can be a great twist to typical marketing tactics for your future events. Henna can last for up to 1-4 weeks at a time, meaning anytime anyone asks the person where they got the Henna, they can easily mention your organization.
<h2>Swag Bags</h2>
This definitely will not be the last time we mention using freebies to promote a future event. Swag bags with your organization's logo on the items are the best and easiest ways to get someone excited for an event. Who doesn’t love free items? <a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/swag-bag-ideas/"">Here</a> is a great article we wrote that shows 3 types of swag bags that your organization can put together.
<h2>Showcase the Speakers</h2>
Showing the future attendees what they could expect from the event is an easy way to promote the credibility of your speakers and get your attendees excited about what they are getting into. Make sure include full bios and job descriptions when marketing the speakers to your audience so they know whether or not they would resonate with these individuals.

Even showcase prominent people that will be attending the event to show attendees who they could potentially run into!
<h2>Dinner and Drinks</h2>
Invite speakers, sponsors, and prominent individuals that will be attending the event for a night out before the event. Make sure to include members of the press for some free event promotion right before the big night!
<h2>Consistent Event Branding</h2>
At the forefront of your organization, the first thing your audience is going to see is your outer visual identity. This would include your name, logo, and overall brand message. Coming up with a notable and catchy visual identity for your organization is going to be key when wanting your brand to speak for you.

Although event promotion is great before an event, keep up with consistent event branding so your overall brand image isn’t lost in your marketing techniques.

10628,"EventBank Partners with Interprefy in Strategic Win for Multi-lingual Event","EventBank has partnered with Interprefy, a remote interpreting service, platform, and mobile app provider as a solution to the technical needs for a multi-lingual event in Shanghai, the Human Resources Employee Benefits Asia 2019 conference. Through a mutual partner, Lighthouse Media, the  Human Resources Employee Benefits Asia 2019 Conference was set to host attendees from across Asia in an effort to bring better benefits strategies and ideas to the table for all industries and keep worked turnover low, something that's a rising trend in Asia.

The conference would play host to different workshops, talks, and seminars that would require a lot of communication between attendees. This presented a challenge as this event ultimately invited a healthy portion of its attendees as single-language speakers who would need interpretation services to help them. This was one challenge among many other challenges that lay at Human Resources's, and thusly Lighthouse Media's, feet like check-in, registration, attendee management, promotion, and more. It was then introduced to the client that Interprefy would handle all of the interpretation challenges through its remote interpretation platform, and EventBank would handle all of the event management challenges through its software platform.

Interprefy provides remote interpreting for events and meetings. The Interprefy platform revolutionizes simultaneous interpreting by replacing old hardware with a cloud-based solution so that interpreters can deliver their services without needing to be onsite, while event participants can simply <span class=""marko5ctiz546"" data-markjs=""true"" data-ogac="""" data-ogab="""" data-ogsc="""" data-ogsb="""">li</span>sten to the language of their choice through their smartphones. Because event and meeting organizers don’t need to fly in interpreters, pay for hotels and organize for interpreting equipment to be installed, they can enjoy the stress-free and cost-effective premium service offered by Interprefy.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-10725 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/delegate.jpg"" alt=""interprefy works with eventbank at human resources online"" width=""1000"" height=""500"" />

Among this technological feat, EventBank was also chosen to lead the digital management and promotion of the event through its event management platform, wherein everything about the event's attendee, ticketing, promotion, and more was handled by the EventBank platform. By its nature, EventBank is an all-in-one event software that combines all the necessary tools that make it easy to manage and experience the event for both event managers and attendees.  From start to finish, attendees can interact with and register for the event online, check in at the event floor, and engaged with sleek promotion tools that can create professional-looking content in just minutes.

By partnering together on the event, Lighthouse and Human Resources were able to flex their digital muscles and promote the event, interpret for attendees, and more, making this an absolute win for everyone involved.

10633,"Data-Driven Marketing &amp; Events Manila (Photos &amp; Recap)","Data-driven marketing is not a new concept, but what’s distinctly different for the changes this time around is the alarmingly quick pace of it all – and for marketers, that means the crucial need to keep up.

On 26 June, EventBank hosted a panel discussion on ‘Data-driven Marketing &amp; Events’ in Manila and was attended by over 50 marketing and event leaders, keen to hear from an amazing panel on how data is the new driving factor on marketing and events.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-10649 size-full"" src=""https://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Panelists-DD-PH-17.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1920"" height=""1080"" />

A lot of insights and leanings are flying around Spaces Makati as our panelists discussed the evolution of managing and promoting events from a few years ago to today where data plays a pivotal role in the advancement of organizing events and how big corporations such as SM Supermalls and Microsoft Philippines shift their marketing spend on digital marketing efforts.

The panel also dived in the use of chatbots on marketing promotions. Previously used only for customer service, nowadays with the advance AI chatbot technologies, marketers are now able to know customer behavior, therefore, can create campaigns that align with their interest. Integrating e-commerce with a chatbot is the next big thing in the Philippines as it is now replacing a lot of marketing channels, including eDMs and ticketing.

Other high points in the discussion are proper targeting and segmenting of marketing databases, engagement burnout, the evolution of SMS marketing and the rise of what we call ‘conversational commerce’.

10712,"10 Membership Survey Questions that Increase Overall Satisfaction","Membership satisfaction is one of the many factors that contribute to either the success or failure of an organization. To increase overall satisfaction and personalization of the relationship between you and your member, send out membership satisfaction questions regularly in order to give people an outlet for their opinions.

Stuck on what questions you should be asking? We got you covered, here are 10 membership survey questions that will be sure to increase your organization's overall satisfaction.

First, it is important to <b>get to know your members</b>. Even if your survey is anonymous, your organization will be able to get engaged how involved this individual is with your organization
<h2>1. How long have you been with our organization?</h2>
With all different types of membership lengths, you may not give the same survey to new members that you give long-term members. Over the years your organization has grown and developed to best fit your membership base, this question is a great way to distinguish the feedback they give from the very beginning.
<h2>2. How did you hear about us?</h2>
Asking members how they heard about your organization is a great question to ask for not only membership satisfaction but, marketing analytics to know what marketing techniques your members responded the best towards.
<h2>3. How many events do you normally attend per quarter?</h2>
Another way to get to know who is taking your survey would be to ask how many events they normally attend per quarter/year. This is an easy way to engage their engagement with your organization.

Ask members to list their least and most favorite events and why to see what you can improve when organizing your next event!

It is also important to know <b>current information from your members</b>.
<h2>4. What type of activities would you like to see more/less of?</h2>
This question is perfect to see what events your members best resonated with and what activities your organization should do more/less of.
<h2>5. Have you ever served on a board/committee with our organization?</h2>
Knowing whether or not the respondent has ever been executive involved with your organization is a good indication of how they will respond to your survey questions. It also helps to have an insider opinion on your organization and how it is going from a point of view who is actively involved with your organization.
<h2>6. How responsive have we been to your questions/concerns about our products?</h2>
This question requires your organization to make sure they are providing the highest quality of customer support, and that your members are being taken care of.
<h2>7. How likely are you to recommend our organization to a friend?</h2>
How likely are you to recommend the organization to a friend is a great indicator of how much value this individual believes your organization is providing to them and potentially other friends. If they say they would be willing to recommend one of their friends, add an additional comment section for that individual's contact information so your organization can get in touch with them!
<h2>8. How likely are you to renew your membership this upcoming year?</h2>
Gage potential retention rates for those already involved with your organization, like many of the other questions this question can easily indicate whether or not your organization is providing value to the consumer.
<h2>9. Do you currently follow us on our social media platforms?</h2>
This is a great question to quickly increase your engagement in regards to your social media profiles if they don’t follow your social media, place links to all your social media pages in the survey so they can stay updated with all of your awesome events!
<h2>10. What is the most efficient way to contact you?</h2>
A great way to end your survey would be to receive their contact information and have them say what the best way to contact them would be! Maybe consider it as your first question so you don't miss out on that valuable contact info.

When it comes down to it, if your organization is not using the information that is being commented on these surveys to better your organization, it is a waste of time for both you and the individuals willing to participate in the survey. Make sure you listen to the people already involved with your organization and change the aspects that need to be changed!

10738,"20 Important Tips to Maximize Millennial Engagement at Your Events","Ever wondered how best to maximize Millennial Engagement at your events? Let’s start by propagating the belief that Millennials in this day and age encompass a mindset. This mindset translates onto the Millennial or Generation Y demographic: the generation that already comprises the largest segment in the workplace and is expected to make up 75% of the workforce by 2030 in the US alone. As stated by <a href=""http://www.meetingmediagroup.com/article/global-summit-to-unpack-millennial-mindset-on-consumer-behaviour"">Rupa Ganatra</a>, Founding Partner of Millennial 20/20 (now <a href=""http://www.futr.today/"">FUTR),</a> ""This mindset extends into consumer patterns and behaviors that are having an evolutionary impact on businesses and brands across the globe.” As such, keeping Millennials in mind when organizing your events is an absolutely crucial way of engaging with a vast and significant population. Words that have been used to define this generation include well-educated, entrepreneurial, digitally savvy, achievement-oriented and ambitious.

A <a href=""https://www.marketingcharts.com/demographics-and-audiences/youth-and-gen-x-29428"">study</a> by the Center for Exhibition Industry Research (CEIR) found that 61% of Millennials aged 18-27 believe that exhibits at exhibitions, conventions and annual meetings are more valuable today than they were 2 years ago. This is a higher percentage than any other respective age group. So, the good news is that Millennials are already likely to be engaged in your event - your job is to maintain this engagement.

This guide offers 20 things to keep in mind when planning an event that will help maximize Millennial engagement.

<h2 id=""communication"">1. Keep Communication as A Top Priority to Enhance Engagement</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-10185 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/assoc-member-grow-blog-copy-4@2x.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

In a world where Millennials have their phones glued to their fingertips almost 24/7, it is clear that events need to be on the ball with regards to communicating. Providing benefits that young professionals really want is critical. But more importantly, communicating these benefits is key. Our world is bigger, faster, brighter and the demands of Millennials grow accordingly. The next few points will detail thoroughly how you can optimize your communication efforts through technology.
<h2 id=""mobile"">2. Develop Your Webpage and Mobile Apps</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-687 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/evnt-1.png"" alt=""Attendee engagement"" width=""491"" height=""685"" />

Keeping your attendees informed with what is happening via notifications can ensure that those wandering attention spans remain firmly trained on the event at hand. Have a well-established event web page and app broadcasting the latest happenings both before, during and after your event. Event Information has to be accessible and robust. Notifications should come from their devices and not an annoying, screechy tannoy!
<h2 id=""wifi"">3. Make Sure You Have Strong Wi-Fi</h2>
It goes without saying that an unstable WiFi connection is a big no-no. Whether or not the stereotype of the Millennial with the short attention span holds true, it is certain that they have come to expect technical convenience and need to be engaged at all times. Ensure your bandwidth is strong enough to accommodate every attendee without delays. Messaging has to be on both websites and their social media – make sure all platforms are covered.
<h2 id=""battery"">4. Provide Battery Charging Stations</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-9967 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/retention-strategy@2x.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

A guest’s phone running out of battery could essentially be game over. Whilst they might admittedly find their time “off-grid” refreshing, their online interaction with the event is curtailed and thus their engagement with the technology made to support the event is not possible. You could combine this prerequisite for the event with an opportunity to satiate the Millennials’ desire for “free stuff” - hand out power-banks with your company’s logo on it.
<h2 id=""beacon"">5. Use Beacon Technology</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5919 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/assoc-member-grow-blog@2x.png"" alt=""9 tricks to grow association membership"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Allow even more real-time information using this new technology that allows event organizers to send push notifications to guests as they pass certain areas. Attendees will be able to know instantly what vendors, presentations, speakers or information points are nearby satisfying a Millennial craving for instantaneous knowledge.
<h2 id=""hashtags"">6. #Hashtags</h2>
<b>Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Public bathrooms –</b> drop those hashtags wherever you can and encourage people to use it on all platforms when talking about the event. You want to be able to hear that social media buzz ringing in your ears and Millennials want to see what the event community has to post about their experience. Everyone wants to see if an event has been “liked” or “shared” by our peers. Hashtags are now a common part of any event success story.
<h2 id=""kiss"">7. Remember the KISS Principle</h2>
Coined in the ’60s and proved widely popular as a slogan in the ’70s, the KISS principle stands for Keep It Simple, Stupid (I claim no credit for the insult). Simplicity is the keyword for Millennials. Their constant exposure to ever-evolving tech has nurtured an addiction to convenience. Any delay in the attendee experience could be irritating and result in consequences for your event engagement. Tickets should be easy to buy and apps easy to install and use. Focus entirely on the ease and speed to keep your guests captivated.
<h2 id=""interactivity"">8. Involve Interactivity</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2144 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/sustainable_2-1.jpeg"" alt="""" width=""1466"" height=""783"" />

Another opportunity to optimize your use of digital tech: Millennials, dubbed as “digital natives”, have grown up in an age of information. About 5 exabytes of information courses through the internet each day – the equivalent to 40,000 two hour standard definition movies per second. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/future-focused-it/video/2019/jan/21/is-the-information-age-coming-to-an-end-video"">However, some strategists are suggesting this age is giving way to the experience age.</a> AI, chatrooms and more have changed the standard one-way transfer of information into a flow between organization and consumer. Millennials want to be involved in conversations and promoting interactivity in your events is, therefore, a necessity. Turn lectures into a dialogue; introduce activities that promote engagement; and capitalize on any opportunities for peer learning.
<h2 id=""relax"">9. Offer Opportunities to Unplug</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3787 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/adult-blur-books-261909.jpg"" alt=""How to prepare an event pitch"" width=""1512"" height=""1080"" />

Plot twist – because of Millennials’ love-hate relationship with technology, encouraging attendees to unplug can also help encourage their engagement. Having a phone or at least photo free areas can help foster an environment of exclusivity exactly because it cannot be shared with the masses.
<h2 id=""sustainability"">10. Keep Sustainability in Mind</h2>
This generation is also committed to living “lives of purpose” as well as corporate responsibility and sustainability. According to <a href=""https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/millennialsurvey.html"">The Deloitte Global Millennial Survey 2019</a>, “Younger generations are putting their money where their mouths are when it comes to supporting businesses that make a positive impact on society.” However, it has also been shown that Millennials have less money to be able to leverage into consumer power. Having an event that shares these sustainable principles allows them to live a socially aware life and scores points for your event.
<h2 id=""green"">11. Go Green</h2>
<h2><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2136 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/green-peace.jpeg"" alt=""sustainability, sustainable event management, sustainale"" width=""1498"" height=""1001"" /></h2>
Paperless check-in is both an easy and environmentally friendly option. Your mobile event apps should include online registration. The app will also give you a chance to offer promotional discounts, partner collateral, event information, and real-time updates. Additional brownie points from Mother Earth for this one!
<h2 id=""&quot;networking"">12. Encourage Networking</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-265 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/networking-event-e1495422285915.jpg"" alt=""collecting photos after event"" width=""1024"" height=""481"" />

Although the majority of Millennials have grown up alongside a vast online Neverland, this tech-savvy group doesn’t underestimate the value of face-to-face interaction. According to a survey of Millennials conducted by <a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/blog/millennials-event-trends-ds00/"">Eventbrite, Ipsos and CrowdDNA</a> “Nearly 80% say that attending live events makes them feel more connected to other people, the community, and the world.” Ensure that your event has plenty of networking opportunities. Facilitate ice breakers to relieve some of the initial pressures that may keep the guests from engaging. Millennials may be the moguls of online networking, but a shove in the right direction can help those who still need the confidence to get involved in person.
<h2 id=""referral"">13. Offer the Option to Bring a Friend</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3221 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/hub-graphics.png"" alt=""Event Space Partnerships"" width=""339"" height=""320"" />

Make networking less intimidating for your attendees by offering incentives to bring a friend. Studies have found that events that do this often have a higher turn-out among Millennials and consequently have greater Millennial engagement.
<h2 id=""family"">14. Make Your Event Family-Friendly</h2>
Over half of Millennials are now parents, so making your event family-friendly can be very beneficial to encouraging engagement. There are a variety of options available to achieve this. Offer onsite childcare services or facilities allows parents to relax and get involved without worrying about babysitters. Host games and activities where the whole family can get involved. A positive, integrated experience makes it more likely that Millennial parents will share their positive experience online!
<h2 id=""experience"">15. Keep the Experience of Your Guests at the Forefront of Your Planning</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4955 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/vr-article.png"" alt=""event tech"" width=""1200"" height=""644"" />

Experience overlaps significantly with interactivity. Having events that promote the two together is a recipe for success. The <a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/blog/millennials-event-trends-ds00/"">Eventbrite study</a> identifies that 75% of Millennials prioritize experiences over products and food. The more unique experiences on offer at your events, the more social media traffic you will receive and Millennial engagement. As we mentioned before, interactive AI and community chatrooms can be part of the equation – but also think of pop-up mini-events, twitter walls, exciting photo opportunities, multi-sensory booths, and live streaming. The list could go on. Consider unique opportunities that aim to augment the attendee experience.
<h2 id=""catering"">16. Think Through Your Catering Options</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-6 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/sandwich.jpg"" alt="""" width=""2000"" height=""1200"" />

Food has become a vital part of an experience too. Frequently dubbed the “phone eats first” generation, Millennial social media activity spikes when there's interesting, unusual, and delicious - or in other words “insta-worthy” - food around. Correlating your catering with an overall event theme can help cinch that insta-potential foodie post and promotion of your event with it. An interactive food station or bar can hit the nail on the head combining experience, food and photo opportunities to result in a hashtaggable social media post that promotes your organization. Think waffle bars, taco bars, donut walls, coffee foam selfies – or just get creative!
<h2 id=""think"">17. Think Outside of The Event</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5300 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/artists-audience-band-1763075.jpg"" alt=""recruiting event"" width=""1512"" height=""1080"" />

Ticking the experience box again: offering group activities or scheduling events outside the conference will help the event community network before the event and encourage their inter-connectivity during the event. Organizing early morning breakfast meetups or run clubs, or even just offering advice on things to do in the area, will help enhance the overall experience. As we’ve demonstrated, Millennials are all about the experience!
<h2 id=""fomo"">18. Capitalize On FOMO</h2>
According to <a href=""https://skift.com/2017/07/12/millennials-are-attending-events-in-droves-because-of-fear-of-missing-out/"">Aubrey Nowowiejski</a> (executive producer at <u><a href=""http://www.coteriespark.com/"">Coterie Spark</a> corporate-event planning</u> firm), FOMO is the buzzword of the moment “It’s all about projecting to your social media network and painting a picture of a phenomenal lifestyle. They (Millennials) chase experiences over things to get those likes and comments and interactions, and that dopamine fix.” Perks for guests of events can help foster a sense of exclusivity that has Millennials keen to get involved with your next event for FOMO. Automatically entering attendees in a draw with a variety of prizes, offering custom favors or swag bags, providing a wealth of exciting food, drinks, experiences and designs all encourage guests to learn more about your event, spread the word, and return.
<h2 id=""swag"">19. Don’t Forget the Free Stuff: Swag-Bags</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3149 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/swag-bag@2x.png"" alt=""swag bag ideas"" width=""1920"" height=""1003"" />

We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again. To elaborate, <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/swag-bag-ideas"">swag bag</a> = goodie bag. These gifts hark back to the good ol’ days of party bags at kid’s birthday parties but have evolved to replace birthday cake, balloons and small toys with <a href=""https://www.linderobrands.com/"">promotional items</a> or samples that advertise your organization. Additional points if you make your swag bag digital, demonstrating a commitment to sustainability Millennials like to see. If you want to stay more traditional, we already have a great article on what to include in your swag-bags – check it out <a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/swag-bag-ideas/"">here</a>.
<h2 id=""momentum"">20. Keep Up Your Event Momentum</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3035 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/email-3249062_1280.png"" alt=""association management software automation"" width=""1280"" height=""716"" />

Keeping your guests engaged after the event further cements the chances of retaining and gaining attendees for the future. A cool idea is to send your guests a thank-you letter with some of the highlights from the event and encourage them to upload their pics using the event hashtags. Having a photo booth or photographer at the event that posts photos a week after will also add to the nostalgia effect – Millennials appreciate any content that can be added to their social media!

There you have it!

Don’t be intimidated by the prospect of events planning for this evolved and digitally demanding demographic. Simply consider the culture in which they were raised: the exponential acceleration of technology, the dawn of virtual connectivity, the vast importance of new trends, the growing appreciation, and understanding of sustainability and the competitive atmosphere that shrouds them. Selfies, hashtags and digital tech dominate in this landscape. Gone are the days of passive consumerism and spectatorship – Millennials want to be actively involved in experiences. Encourage their engagement with your event and ultimately your brand by picking and choosing from this guide what is right for you.

10764,"7 Event Room Layouts that Encourage Networking","Planning something as simple as event room layouts can hugely impact attendee engagement. Although it is easily skipped over by organizers, it is key to creating memorable events and rewarding networking.

Networking allows people to build an organic community that represents them and can foster their interests. Any possible collaboration that comes from it produces innovation that can drive future ventures forward. Although networking can be done online, nothing beats the personable nature of face-to-face interaction. Not only are they perceived as more <a href=""https://www.virgin.com/entrepreneur/infographic-the-importance-of-face-to-face-networking"">credible</a>, but general perceptions of sincerity are also heavily determined by non-verbal cues; with face-to-face meetings generating higher volumes of quality, original ideas.

Encouraging networking is about creating an environment where people feel comfortable enough to make this happen. Traditional events prioritize attendee numbers which can often come at the cost of organic interactions, but non-conventional spacial arrangements offer more variety depending on the type of atmosphere you are trying to achieve.

In case you’re in need of some tips on how to get people mixing and matching at your event, we’ve got 7 below!

Extending the networking life cycle beyond the online world begins with atmosphere. Relaxed, low lighting with standing tables encourages people to flow through any event space which avoids the overcrowding that often occurs around drinks stations. With that comes the freedom to mingle, roam and speak to new people. In a cocktail layout, there is no sitting space for attendees. It allows for maximum room capacity which is the most efficient use of space while multiplying the potential number of interactions between attendees.

You could even consider segmenting breakout spaces between louder, chatty areas of conversation for experienced professionals and quieter ones for first-timers who prefer one-on-one conversations. Sitting for long periods of time can stifle creativity and drain the energy from a room, so keeping attendees on their feet in a cocktail setting balances catering for individual needs while still creating a welcoming inclusive space.
<h2 id=""clusters"">Clusters</h2>
[caption id=""attachment_10791"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""634""]<img class=""wp-image-10791 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_3924.png"" alt=""Cluster event layout"" width=""634"" height=""450"" /> Image from Encore-Anzpac[/caption]

Small groups can be shepherded together in a cluster arrangement, matched together in groups of four or less in closed circles with some chairs and a small table between them. As another casual layout, it is best suited to team exercises because it allows individuals to familiarize themselves with each other on a closer, intimate level.

Round tables ensure that people are constantly facing each other, provoking natural conversation. The number of tables and chairs used will naturally depend on the size of the venue and number of attendees being accommodated.

Creating ready-made teams removes the awkwardness of having to choose who to talk to from a room of strangers, getting attendees straight into the mix of socializing! Depending on how well you know your attendees, you can assign them together based on common interests, goals or job roles so that they have more to discuss past the standard “what’s your name?” style of questions.
<h2 id=""pods"">Pods</h2>
[caption id=""attachment_10803"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""634""]<img class=""wp-image-10803 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Banquet-Style.png"" alt=""Pod event layout"" width=""634"" height=""450"" /> Image from Encore-Anzpac[/caption]

Pods are larger in capacity than clusters so can hold more people within each setup, but utilize square shaped tables instead. Great for team building, they perform the same function as clusters in grouping people together. Pods have a special place in startup and entrepreneurial culture due to their naming which makes them a perfect match for events within these fields. However, they can have a tendency to form ‘silo’ style bubbles which attendees may lean towards comfortably remaining within without branching out to other tables due to the insular nature of the arrangement.

To encourage people to network outside of their immediate circles, pods can be used with timed sessions to ensure attendees' networking reach is maximized. Switching tables every hour, for example, allows a greater number of people to interact whilst still generating quality conversation between them.

For the planners who prefer to go the extra step in their floor plans, you can designate select seats for specific attendees to not only create a more personalized experience but to equally craft specific relationships between professionals.
<h2 id=""lounge"">Lounge</h2>
[caption id=""attachment_10807"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""686""]<img class=""wp-image-10807 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lounge-event-layout-e1562311232340.png"" alt=""lounge event layout"" width=""686"" height=""597"" /> Image from FitSmallBusiness[/caption]

Creative seating arrangements that include a mixture of chairs, sofas, bar tables, beanbags, and ottomans form part of the general lounging experience in many venues. If your event has a theme, furniture can be customized to match any aesthetic and create an enhanced attendee experience. With quality refreshments, lounges can keep people within a venue as there is often too much going on inside to miss out on. Building rapport is easier in a more relaxed setting, so lounges are the natural go-to for events that aren’t excessively formal.

By placing the lowest level seating at the front of a room, you can overcome any viewing problems as every attendee should be able to see over the shoulders of the person in front of them. If presentations are being made by facilitators, they are in full view of everyone present and can create the type of dialogue that gets the whole room talking.
<h2 id=""solution"">Solution Wall</h2>
[caption id=""attachment_10801"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""421""]<img class=""wp-image-10801 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/affinity_diagram.jpg"" alt=""Solution wall event layout"" width=""421"" height=""331"" /> Image from Middle East Technical University[/caption]

A solution wall does exactly what it says - it creates tangible solutions for multiple professionals struggling in similar areas. By utilizing one huge blank wall, attendees can use stickers to publicly display their needs. Other attendees can respond by sticking another sticker (of an opposing color) on top of the previous one to create an interaction between two strangers. Between them, contact details can be exchanged in the hopes of tackling said problem together, creating an area of common interest.

Solution walls are aimed at creating selfless relationships in which professionals can help others at little to no cost to themselves. If you want to stimulate your own thought-provoking discussion among attendees, you can always tag your own questions on the board too, encouraging people to think in a direction where others can meet them halfway. Questions like “what do you hate about your job?” are sure to generate anonymous responses. Keith Ferrazzi’s recognition that “the currency of real networking is not greed but generosity” emphasizes that in helping others, we help ourselves.
<h2 id=""horsehshoe"">Horseshoe</h2>
[caption id=""attachment_10802"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""634""]<img class=""wp-image-10802 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Horse-Shoe.png"" alt=""Horseshoe event layout"" width=""634"" height=""450"" /> Image by Encore-Anzpac[/caption]

A three-sided U-shape with one open end, the horseshoe allows attendees to face each other whilst engaging with any presentations, speakers or facilitators. For workshop and discussion-style events, the horseshoe arrangement can be ideal for promoting interaction without forcing attendees into physical arrangements that demand it.

You can even include tables if attendees are consuming food or drink. Horseshoe positioning can make its use less practical for smaller venues because they take up a lot of space and are an awkward shape. Where space allows, however, horseshoes can be a useful mass networking tool to round off a busy event agenda by bringing everyone right back together at the end.

Keeping participant numbers low (below 20) is best for this event room layout, as too many people will widen the shape and attendees may no longer be able to see or hear each other. As the semi-circle shape is a rounder version of the horseshoe, both styles are more inviting and have better chances of absorbing new people into them. Exchanging business cards and LinkedIn connections is the natural follow on, bonding people both in the real world and on social media.
<h2 id=""fishbowl"">Fishbowl</h2>
[caption id=""attachment_10805"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1128""]<img class=""wp-image-10805 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Fishbowl_diagram_172-1.png"" alt=""Fishbowl event layout"" width=""1128"" height=""1119"" /> Image by Wikipedia[/caption]

Fishbowls are all about dialogue. To create one, four or five chairs are positioned in an inner circle (forming the actual fishbowl) while eight to ten chairs are placed in a circular pattern around them. Some attendees can take the inner fishbowl seats while others occupy the ones surrounding them. For discussion-style events, this layout is ideal for starting conversations (the more interesting the topic, the better the conversation it provokes in people!).

In an open fishbowl, one seat within the inner circle can be left free, allowing anyone from the outer circle to rejoin the conversation at any moment. At the same time, another member from the inner circle can give up their seat for another person to join the group, ensuring that the flow of participants remains varied over time.

Open discussion is key to success, as it enables the entire group to actively participate and get involved in asking questions, making suggestions and giving their own conclusions. Individual personalities can present themselves far more confidently, allowing attendees to gravitate towards those they are more compatible within a natural way.

It is important to remember that creating an environment fit for networking does not only come down to event room layouts - all aspects of the space should widen communication and create interaction for attendees.

Mixing and matching the spacial arrangements we’ve listed above is a definite way to foster collaboration between attendees. SaaStr’s 2019 upgrade to a larger venue includes the creation of <a href=""https://www.saastr.com/first-timers-guide-to-saastr-annual-2019/"">Brain Dates</a> specifically designed for networking and proves that there is a growing focus on promoting networking within the events industry.

Giving attendees what they want will always involve some element of <a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/planning-events-growth-guide/"">planning</a>, and sometimes it's the smallest things that have the greatest effect. In this case, it is the <i>where a</i>nd the <i>how </i>that matters most.

<em>Psst.</em> Did you know that there's one surefire way to get a room full of people to talk to each other? <strong>Don't use any chairs</strong>. It's a rising trend at networking events that no chairs are provided and attendees are encouraged to walk around the room in bump into people they wouldn't have normally spoken too had they had the chance to sit down and stay in one place for a good amount of time.

Event room layouts are just a small piece of the puzzle when it comes to event smoothness. Think about your check-in process. Registration online. Engagement via Emails. There are smarter ways to increase your ROI on events. <strong>Book a demo </strong>with EventBank and find out how an all-in-one event management solution can boost your ROI today.

<h4 style=""text-align: center""><strong>首次实现CRM数据全渠道自动汇总和追踪</strong></h4>
在过去的活动中，FT中文网使用自有定制的活动注册页面来收集参会者的信息。但是平台数据分散，各类表单并不能自动且智能的汇总；数据割裂，对活动效果很难追踪和评估；普通的会议平台要么无法沉淀CRM数据，要么对CRM数据缺乏分析和再利用；数据的整理和分析耗费大量时间，数据的动态也很难做到实时追踪。

在2015年FT中文网使用EventBank的企业活动营销及销售线索收集一体化平台后，首次实现了CRM数据的全渠道的自动流入、集中管理以及精准数据追踪。有效提升了潜在的订阅用户和合作伙伴的销售转化。

EventBank的CRM模块打通了活动管理、会员管理、邮件营销、企业官网、活动管理者/参与者客户端以及支付在内的所有与客户联通的环节，使企业整个生态系统中所有合作公司、机构及联系人的相关信息及互动历史数据能够从不同渠道实时流入并留存。

不止如此，在EventBank的CRM模块控制面板，管理人员可以直观地查看新增CRM数据、实时地了解CRM联系人/公司的动态更新，以及智能地管理数据中的新增机会和活跃机会。

<h4 style=""text-align: center""><strong>使用EventBank活动营销云</strong></h4>
<h4 style=""text-align: center""><strong>突破性完成线上线下CRM数据整合和有效追踪</strong></h4>
推陈出新的持续高频活动不止能激活已经存在的CRM联系人，更能触及更多潜在订阅读者和合作伙伴。但不仅是活动前期准备耗时耗力，活动前中后期线上线下的数据也割裂难以整合。

活动前期的线上邀请、活动中期的现场签到、活动后期的问卷反馈，一系列数据都是提升活动营销效果的重要依据。然而，线上与线下仿佛是两座数据孤岛，在以往没有CRM管理平台能够对线上和线下的数据实现立体式的打通，更无法满足高频活动的需求。想要保持高质量的平台搭建、邀请函设计、活动营销邮件推广、现场签到、活动数据追踪会让市场部门超负荷运转，且无法高质量完成活动目标。

通过使用EventBank一体化云平台，FT中文网轻松打破了以上的活动营销难题。3年多的时间里，FT中文网成功举办了34场不同规模、不同主题的活动。
<ul class=""list-paddingleft-2"">
 	<li>针对CRM内对联系人“标签化”的追踪和精准的分析，成为了活动营销的主题来源；</li>
 	<li>自动化和智能化的活动管理云模块则帮助其优化了活动的整个生命周期，成为了高频高效活动营销的基础；</li>
 	<li>通过EventBank一体化云平台进行活动营销时，实现了活动前期的邀请及注册数据、中期活动签到及参与数据以及后期的活动反馈数据全部自动流入CRM，完成了从线上到线下的数据整合和追踪，从收集到拓展CRM数据的流畅闭环。</li>
</ul>
值得一提的是，EventBank的活动现场签到实时数据展示，使FT中文网的活动管理者和组织者在世界的任何一个角落能够实时查看活动的注册、参会、互动情况。参会者签到后不只将联系人数据自动汇入到CRM中，其具体的行为（何时/由谁进行签到，参加了哪个分会场活动等）也会被实时的追踪和记录，作为重要的转化数据被留存下来。

这使得每一次活动都真正拓展了CRM联系人的数据和信息，能够帮助企业发现更多潜在订阅读者和合作伙伴。

<h4 style=""text-align: center""><strong>EventBank提升内容价值</strong></h4>
<h4 style=""text-align: center""><strong>邮件营销也能精准转化</strong></h4>
传统的邮件营销平台只提供邮件分发的功能，营销邮件是否有效全凭内容营销人员的经验判断；邮件发送后的数据追踪也无法做到实时和精准，是否存在商业机会更无法评估。

通过使用EventBank与CRM管理模块相连的邮件营销模块，FT中文网实现了通过CRM内联系人自定义分组的个性化邮件营销——针对不同人群、不同话题甚至不同语言，能够发送不同的营销邮件；通过分析CRM内的分组数据和其对应的邮件数据（邮件打开率、点击行为等），内容营销人员能够得到更立体的洞察，不断创作更优质的内容以提升商业机会的转化。
<h4 style=""text-align: center""><strong>成功可复制</strong></h4>
<h4 style=""text-align: center""><strong>使用EventBank实现90天潜客增长777个</strong></h4>
无独有偶，我们的其他客户也通过综合运用EventBank一体化云平台实现了更高更快速的CRM数据和潜在机会增长。

波兰美国商会使用EventBank一体化云平台，90天内就新增了<strong>777</strong>个客户数据。多渠道的数据汇总不止增加了机会，可视化的管理员平台更能够直观地对CRM增长进行监控和管理，不错过任何一个商业机会。
<h4 style=""text-align: center""><strong>EventBank一体化云平台更多亮点</strong></h4>
EventBank一体化云平台采取全球最高安全标准，全面保证客户的CRM数据安全，这也是获得FT中文网等全球客户信赖的重要原因。

此之外，EventBank特有的多币种聚合收款云模块，已提供50个币种和8个国内外主流线上支付渠道。聚合收款云模块将多网关进行整合，自动追踪、分析并记录所有线上与线下的收款信息，通过云端平台强大的在线支付功能，轻松快速地完成收款，安全便捷。

10866,"Save Your Chamber - Your Members Need You","Member-centric organizations firmly believe in their mission. They want to provide quality service to their communities and <strong>foster economic prosperity</strong>. With the world shifting towards a society driven by technology, any question can be answered by doing a quick search on your smartphone. Chambers of Commerce <strong>rely on software</strong> to mobilize their daily operations and innovate in their value propositions.

It is no secret that <strong>with the right software</strong> Chambers can stay ahead of their members’ needs and make better decisions faster. With the ability to track interactions, they know what content works best and are well aware of how much value they are providing and <strong>how much impact</strong> they have in their community.

EventBank has been working for years with Chambers and membership-based organizations all over the world, learning how to approach different types of membership management. We have built a platform that helps to turn <strong>weaknesses into strengths</strong>, with the use of <strong>simple and beautiful user experience</strong> that accommodate even the most complicated processes. From websites to event pages, invoicing, and email marketing, all aspects have been carefully <strong>designed to satisfy</strong> the needs of even the most demanding organizations and communities.

We call those Chambers that are willing to<strong> go the extra mile</strong> for their members, save them from inefficient processes and<strong> switch to better software</strong>. We know change is difficult so <strong>onboarding is on us</strong>! Your members need you.

10936,"30 Creative Hackathon Ideas that Push Innovation","2018 was a golden year for hackathons following a spike of<strong> <a href=""https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/developers/hackathons-report-2018/"">140%</a></strong> in 2017 and there will be many more to come. Standard hackathons follow the routine I mentioned earlier, but there are new ways of doing things.

If great minds think alike then hackathons are a great way of putting them in the same room, giving them snacks and leaving them together to create magic. Hackathon ideas are the center of innovation, they are responsive to change and find solutions to problems twice their size. Our creative hackathon ideas promise twice the excitement and we’ve got 30 of them!

Cross-team collaboration is best between people who work in the same company. But what about working against other departments within this to step up the competition? Not only does this cement workplace bonds, but working against another team can sharpen everyone’s focus on developing the best idea.

In a department vs department arrangement, IT could fight it out with marketing, design, product team, and HR. By trying to out-think each other on creative hackathon ideas they could strengthen their communication skills and win eternal bragging rights in the staff room.
<blockquote><strong>Did you know?
</strong>There were:
3450 Hackathons in 2016
4480 Hackathons in 2017
5636 Hackathons in 2018</blockquote>
<h2 id=""theme"">Give it a Theme</h2>
Themes make everything fun. With one, you can give your hackathon idea some creative direction and give your participants something to be enthusiastic about. No theme is too simple and depending on the location your event layout can reflect the theme and become fully immersive for participants.

If you’re struggling to pick a cool theme for your hackathon, the good news is that you can’t go wrong. As long as social media creates a buzz, your hackathon will be able to foster engagement both online and in the real world.
<blockquote><strong>Did you know?</strong>
Majority of Hackathons happen in the US?
Far less Hackathons are going on in Asia.</blockquote>
<h2 id=""movement"">Create a Movement</h2>
The potential solutions that can come from hackathons are endless. With the creative input of a team, any product created can be used for good as part of a wider movement. Whether you are interested in education, healthcare or environmental responsibility, the best causes are usually those that appeal to people’s hearts.

In India, hackathons are used to give public health the kick start it needs in finding solutions. In the NITI Aayog Pune Smart City Hackathon, Anashwar Tech came up with a water disinfection container cover plate that uses digital purification from UV-C light to purify water containers. Governments and NGOs are recognizing hackathons as authentic change makers, with India, USA, Canada, and UK ranking as top <a href=""https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/developers/hackathons-report-2018/"">hosts</a>.
<blockquote><strong>Did you know?</strong>
37% of participants are Developers, 18% are engineers, and 9% are Data Scientists</blockquote>
<h2 id=""experience"">Include All Experience Levels</h2>
From beginners to intermediates and experts; everyone has something to contribute, whether it is expertise, ideas or leadership. It’s not just the product that wins a team a hackathon, creating it involves a process. Getting everyone involved is a sure way to encourage teamwork and guarantees that everyone will learn something from another teammate, no matter how small.
<blockquote><strong>Did you know? </strong>
The most popular developer language in a Hackathon is JavaScript.</blockquote>
<h2 id=""big"">Go Big, Go Massive</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1502 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NU-SKIN-global-conference-with-thousands-of-attendees-EventBank-event-management-software.png"" alt=""hackathon ideas big event"" width=""1173"" height=""291"" />

There’s no limit to the number of people that can enter a hackathon at any time. The largest ever recorded was at MHacks in 2013, with 1214 hackers in total. As long as resources and plug outlets can stretch to accommodate numbers, there’s little reason why added participants can’t double the fun.

Efficient and robust server hardware can accommodate a larger attendance pool, along with generous numbers of equipment including projectors, HDMI cables, and adaptors to create a high-resolution experience for your participants.
<blockquote><strong>Did you know?
</strong>Only 64% of Hackathons are Public?</blockquote>
<h2 id=""event"">Host Simultaneous Events</h2>
For non-participants, watching a hackathon for hours on end can be boring. By organizing another event at the same time, you can diversify your event’s attendance and encourage networking between attendees. Structuring talks and workshops during the day will attract more visitors, create awareness and make your hackathon more than average - it can become an inspiring hub for innovation.
<blockquote><strong>Did you know?
</strong>Of Internal Hackathons, majority are for Retail and Finance hacking</blockquote>

Everyone has access to technology. With a stable internet connection, there’s no reason that a team from New Delhi can’t hack alongside a team from Los Angeles with a live stream between them.

Introducing globally remote teams can take your hackathon to the international level. The average hackathon ranges from 24 to 48 hours, so as long as time zone differences are accounted for, each remote team can work when they have the best resources available to them to cement an idea with the potential to create global change.
<blockquote><strong>Did you know?
</strong>Most Public Hackathons are for Technology or Transportation</blockquote>
<h2 id=""prototype"">Prototype Challenge</h2>
At the end of most hackathons, teams present their work to judges. However, you can add a twist to yours by challenging the competing teams to create a working prototype. For those that fail to make a product that operates, it's their loss.

The challenge of bringing an idea to life as a real product means that participants can’t simply have their heads in the clouds, at some point it will have to come back down. Most ideas are not perfect the first time around, so it’s best not to expect polished products. By testing their utility, ideas become more refined and more likely to help the audience they are intended for.

The goals for Internal Hackathons include Inspiration, Team Building, and Internal Entrepreneurship Projects</blockquote>
<h2 id=""musical"">Make it Musical</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5300 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/artists-audience-band-1763075.jpg"" alt=""music at hackathons"" width=""1512"" height=""1080"" />

With headphones, each participant can type away while hard at work. But with a coordinated playlist, team members can experience the same songs while working separately. This could make hackathons a less isolating experience and match each unique playlist to a similar theme. Work and play can always mix when music is involved.
<blockquote><strong>Did you know?</strong>
The goals for public hackathons include Product Discovery, Talent Recruiment, and Third-Party Collaboration</blockquote>
<h2 id=""pitch"">Think it, Pitch it!</h2>
The power of ideas is in their business value. Often, this is extracted and presented with data and persuasion to businesses to invest in. Pitching ideas to business owners gives participants experience in scaling ideas, presentation and professional skills for their own personal development.
<blockquote><strong>Did you know?</strong>
21% of Hackathons are based on AI</blockquote>
<h2 id=""corporate"">Go Corporate</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-10724 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/audience.jpg"" alt=""hackathon corporate"" width=""1000"" height=""500"" />

The corporate world demands solutions to complex problems just as much as the social world does. Increasingly, companies are using creative hiring methods to attract the best talent. According to the Talent Acquisition Benchmarking <a href=""https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/developers/attracting-quality-talent-through-hackathons/"">Report</a>, the average cost of hire is $4,425 whereas the average cost of hackathons for hire is $4,000, with the advantage of hiring multiple candidates.

If four employees are hired by conducting a hackathon, the average cost per hire boils down to $1,000 as opposed to $4,425 for conventional hire. Hackathons help in building a pipeline of talent for Gen Z, especially <a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/recruitment-event-ideas/"">students </a>who are looking to get straight into tech from their lecture theatre.
<blockquote><strong>Did you know?
</strong>16% of Hackathons are based on AR/VR</blockquote>
<h2 id=""surprise"">Element of Surprise</h2>
Most hackathons operate on the assumption that participants will be allowed some time to prepare for the task beforehand and will begin it with a full understanding of the set brief. Considering the element of surprise, however, releasing the task with much less time for prep (maybe even none!) could force people to think outside the box.

Only allowing a short window for preparation will benefit the quick, energized thinkers who are capable of making well-planned decisions on the spot and push them right to the front where you can see them.
<blockquote><strong>Did you know?</strong>
12% of Hackathons are based on IOT</blockquote>
<h2 id=""sporty"">Make it Sporty</h2>
Sometimes the hardest part of working on an idea is getting started. Getting the creative juices flowing in your mind can be a struggle, especially with the added pressure of wanting to win. Exercise can get the blood flowing and bring activity to what can be an otherwise stationary activity.

Participants don’t have to get sweaty or dirty in the process. Sport is anything from table tennis to air hockey to yoga, whatever it takes to get participants into the zone!
<blockquote><strong>Did you know?</strong>
11% of Hackathons are based on Security</blockquote>
<h2 id=""welcome"">Welcome New Players</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2129 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/sustainable_2.jpeg"" alt=""hackathon ideas new players"" width=""1466"" height=""1000"" />

Programming’s representation problem can be improved by the inclusion of under-represented groups in hackathons. On International Women’s Day 2018, Raikes Girls created <a href=""https://rosiesays.github.io/about/""><i>Rosie</i></a> at the International Women's Hackathon under the theme of economic freedom. Rosie is a Chrome extension that detects undermining language and suggests more confident phrasing to help women represent themselves as professionals in their communications.

Named after Rosie the Riveter, an American symbol for female empowerment in the workplace, this tool encourages confidence in its users to have business-minded conversations. The solution to representation problems solution can come from inside, all it needs is the space to flourish.
<h2 id=""free"">Make it Free</h2>
To make the competition fully accessible, why not consider making it free? Travel reimbursement, free food, and unlimited drinks can be just the start of perks for participants. Grants and scholarships can act as a hand up for hackers who otherwise wouldn’t be able to access such opportunities.

Removing limitations could open your event to more people than ever and depending on the unique thinkers you attract - this might just become its biggest selling point. You can always consider using sponsors to help manage costs. Depending on the sponsor you secure, it could also give your hackathon some added visibility through exposure.
<h2 id=""industries"">Combine Industries</h2>
If someone from marketing collaborates with someone from the product team and they consult with someone from design, the finishing product is sure to be something great. Having an even-handed team with different skills will create well-rounded ideas that can respond to a wider variety of problems.

Internal hackathons can close off innovation to any staff that isn’t technically specialized as developers or programmers. By opening it up to all disciplines, your hackathon can send the message that there is no place that technology doesn’t meet the real world.
<h2 id=""virtual"">Go Virtual</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4963 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/virtual-reality-app-development-1.jpg"" alt=""virtual reality hackathon"" width=""1197"" height=""800"" />

The<a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/event-vr-guide/""> virtual world</a> sits right next to the digital one so bringing them together could be a way of taking your hackathon to the next level. In the education sector, for example, using virtual reality games to map out activities to help children learn could be both a meaningful and fun idea for developers.
<h2 id=""arty"">Make it Artsy</h2>
We create with our eyes as much as we do with our brains. Focusing on the design of your hackathon will not only improve its visual branding but give it a legacy that can go on for years after its first year. Right down to the venue layout, design can contribute a sense of presence to your event.

It also gives your hackathon an automatic edge on social media as it is easier to promote something is aesthetically pleasing.
<h2 id=""reward"">Reward Risk-Taking</h2>
It’s all too easy to rename a popular idea and reinvent it as your own product. To encourage originality, hackathons must reward risk-taking. After the chaos, participants will be left feeling energized and well prepared to confront any new problems that may crop up in their non-hackathon lives.

Awarding individuals for stepping outside of the norm and braving the judgemental cross-examination of their idea sends the message that problem-solving is not meant to be a simple, comfortable process. The fresh perspective award, anyone?
<h2 id=""merchandise"">Create Merchandise</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3149 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/swag-bag@2x.png"" alt=""hackathon merchanise"" width=""1920"" height=""1003"" />

Why not consider kitting every participant out with gear plastered in your hackathon branding? If you’re feeling extra generous, gift them with extras like laptop stickers, custom USBs and phone cases. This can unify your brand while making sure that participants feel like their contribution is appreciated. You can even follow our <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/swag-bag-ideas/"">swag bag guide</a> to spread branding around during these share-heavy events.
<h2 id=""mentoring"">Mentoring</h2>
Some of the enthusiasts present at a hackathon could have a range of skills, expertise, and experience necessary to pass on to younger participants who may not have begun their careers yet. Mentorship is a great way of creating a new generation of innovative thinkers who are confident enough to act as change-makers in their own communities.
<h2 id=""sustainability"">Consider Sustainability</h2>
<h2><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2061 size-full"" style=""font-size: 16px;"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/jens-johnsson-121803-unsplash-1.jpg"" alt=""sustainability hackathon"" width=""1620"" height=""1080"" /></h2>
Sustainability is one of the most pressing issues of the 21st century so including it as a dominant guide for hackathon briefs is a solid idea.

Green hackathons have grown in popularity, with <a href=""https://www.hackerearth.com/zh/challenges/hackathon/blue-planet-hackathon/"">Blue Planet Hackathon</a> hosting The Fraternity under a pollution control theme and creating a vertical access water turbine in the process. Designed to generate electricity, it traps the energy stored at the surface of the water uses it to generate electric current on a flexible large or small scale.
<h2 id=""urban"">Urban City Planning</h2>
Metropolitan cities face some of the biggest 21st-century challenges and tech is responding to this by creating smart cities. They improve efficiencies and use sustainability to advance economic development in urban areas. This makes them the perfect target area for hackathons by bringing tech and the social world together.
<h2 id=""mission"">Add a Mission Statement</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2049 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tim-marshall-114623-unsplash.jpg"" alt=""mission statement"" width=""1620"" height=""1080"" />

A mission statement has the power to guide your hackathon in the right direction. What is your hackathon’s purpose? Does it have an identity? Basing your mission statement on what you hope to achieve will give your event a sense of authenticity that will organically attract participants.

Millennials are statistically more likely to associate with events tied to good causes. <a href=""https://hackernoon.com/maximize-your-hackathon-impact-by-adopting-the-un-global-goals-for-sustainable-development-a67f9f95159e"">HackerNoon’s </a>Environmental Civics recommends adopting the UN Goals for Sustainable Development. You can also base your choice of judges, subject area and challenge statement on your mission statement to keep a consistent stream running through all your hackathon ideas.
<h2 id=""space"">Take it to Space</h2>
If an idea is genuinely out of this world, maybe it should go to space. Incorporating space into your hackathon encourages your participants to break even more boundaries in their thinking. NASA’s International Space Apps <a href=""https://2018.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/"">Challenge </a>is heading into its eighth year and includes categories titled “Can you build a...”, “Make sense out of Mars” and “Volcanoes, icebergs and asteroids” just to start.
<h2 id=""surprises"">Surprises</h2>
Throwing a few curved balls will force teams to think on their feet. Switching members of the competing teams around halfway through, for example, forces them to become less fixated on ideas and more focused on enabling any idea to become a tangible reality. In this way, the skills participants sharpen are set to become empowering when used in any area of their professional or personal lives.
<h2 id=""multi"">Make it Multi-Platform</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-10124 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/EB_Chambers-Training-Beijing-12.jpg"" alt=""multi platform hackathon"" width=""1920"" height=""1080"" />

Solutions can take a variety of forms; from software to websites to mobile. The options are almost endless as long as they are technically possible to implement and can be user-friendly. By allowing the products created to be multi-platform, you will create an even wider array of products that are optimized for the best user experiences.
<h2 id=""comedy"">Comedy</h2>
Between intense brainstorming sessions and snack breaks, participants need the kind of entertainment that can relax and prepare them for their next session. The light relief of comedy is good for creating a positive, lighthearted atmosphere. Stand-up comedy, short shows, and card games encourage everyone to come back together and take a more laid back approach to hackathon ideas.
<h2 id=""prizes"">Prizes Worth Winning</h2>
Spending hours creating and executing a hackathon idea deserves the kind of reward that will make participants feel appreciated. Not only tangible cash prizes and free tickets but opportunities to network and take their ideas to the next level. Even incorporating one year's winning team into future events gives them the chance to establish a brand of their own.
<h2 id=""repeat"">Repeat it!</h2>
When branded well, hackathons can take on a reputation of their own and grow to become very popular and well attended in the future. Your event shouldn’t end at the close of the day when everyone leaves the venue. Why not make yours an annual hackathon? A lasting culture of collaboration and ideas is one that gives equal value to its organizers and participants.

With time, you might even want to expand further!

Hackathons have the potential to capture the mind of anyone who attends. Organizing hackathons can be an extremely rewarding experience and doing this creatively makes sure that whatever you do will be unique and inspired.

10954,"The 24 Rights and Wrongs When Catering at Events","<p data-wp-editing=""1"">What are the rights and wrongs of event catering?</p>
<p data-wp-editing=""1"">So, you have everything set for your big event; guest lists, speakers, sponsors and an amazing event management platform however you are still working out the second most important thing- event catering! This is something that even the most experienced event organizers need to pay close attention to. Food is essential to an all-day event and what guests often look forward to the most, a bad caterer will equal unhappy guests as we enter an era of ‘the foodies’.</p>
According to Eventbrite's <a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/blog/academy/food-at-events-catering/"">One Poll survey</a>, 74% of Americans are guaranteed to show up to an event if they know the food will be good. This shows the impact food can have in terms of event attendance.

However, we know there are many different factors that go into event catering meaning it can be daunting to organize.  It is important to research and plan your catering properly for an event so as not to make any large mistakes. This is why we have done the work for you and put together our 24 rights and wrongs for every element of event catering. Going into detail on what types of food to serve to please everyone and make an impact, what service should be provided to the guests when catering and how to impress your guests whilst still sticking to a budget.
<h2 id=""top"">What food are you serving?</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2133 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/vegetables.jpeg"" alt=""Sourcing ingredients locally for events catering "" width=""1500"" height=""1000"" />
<h3>Rights:</h3>
<div data-section-style=""7"">

<strong>Ensure</strong> your event catering suits everyone's dietary needs, your guests are likely to have intolerance's and allergies to different foods. So make sure to offer many different options such as gluten-free and vegan. You can even check this before the event by adding a 'Dietary requirement' box on your EventBank registration form for your guests to fill out.

<strong>Be innovative</strong> with the food choices, trends are forever changing so make sure you keep up with the times. A spectacular food showcase could even bring you in some user-generated content on social media- think avocado's on toast in rose shapes at breakfast and Bento boxes for lunch.

<strong>Double-check</strong> that your food choices reflect the seasons, your guests probably won’t appreciate a hot pot in the middle of August.

<strong>Support</strong> your local trade shop, buying fresh produce locally will help your community along with tasting better. It is also a way to promote sustainable event catering by reducing the food miles.

</div>
<h3>Wrongs</h3>
<div data-section-style=""7"">

<strong>Ignore</strong> health regulations, these change in every region so be sure to check out the local laws so you don’t end up with a hefty fine. Even worse- end up leaving your guests with food poisoning. No one wants their event to be remembered for the time half the guests ended up in a hospital!

<strong>Allow</strong> the food to be cooked too early, this could mean that it goes cold and loses flavor. It may leave your guests with a 'cheap' and 'unprofessional' impression of the event management. This also has the potential to ruin the overall event atmosphere.

</div>
<h2>Event Catering Service, The rights and Wrongs:</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-11054 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photo-1516788875874-c5912cae7b43-1.jpg"" alt=""Events caterers serving at an event"" width=""600"" height=""399"" />
<h3>Rights</h3>
<strong>Arrange</strong> enough food for all of your guests, nobody wants to be left hungry and disappointed.
<div data-section-style=""7"">

<strong>Make sure</strong> you have enough staff for the event, this is important not only to serve your guests but also to keep the area clean and tidy. Guests will not appreciate trying to eat their dessert with a dirty dinner plate still in front of them.

<strong>Be specific</strong> with your caterer to make sure they understand exactly what you want to be served, write everything down and double-check this over. Event catering is very important and is something that will definitely be remembered by guests so ensure it is correct.

<strong>Revise</strong> everything thoroughly, rushing your events catering could leave your guests hungry and upset.

<strong>Hire</strong> caterers who are more than just catering companies, they can also double up as entertainers through a variety of activities from dancers to comedians. There are endless possibilities to keep your guests entertained and give the WOW factor.

</div>
<h3>Wrongs</h3>
<div data-section-style=""7"">

<strong>Ignore</strong> the technical details of the event- if you are offering a buffet-style meal be certain the room is large enough for your guests to walk around. If a knife and fork are needed to eat make sure that you have tables for guests to sit at- if they must stand cocktail style canapés are best.

<strong>Let your guests</strong> wait around in long lines for food, instead its best to make sure you have enough servers to fit with your attendee size. If the meal is buffet style rather than sit down take care that there are enough serving stations for lines to quickly move through the dining area. A tip for very large events is to phase meal times into different groups of guests.

<strong>Forget</strong> to leave intervals between dishes, guests will want the opportunity to socialize and rest in between eating. Also, during large events guests are likely to receive their food at different times meaning that you risk one table eating their dessert whilst the table next to them begins their main.

<strong>Leave</strong> dirty plates and glasses lying around, the appearance of the room is important and adds to the overall event atmosphere. It is bad practice to leave guests with dirty plates in front of them whilst they drink and socialize.

</div>
<h2>Keeping to an event catering budget, Rights and Wrongs:</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-11055 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photo-1518458028785-8fbcd101ebb9.jpg"" alt=""Budget saving for event catering"" width=""600"" height=""400"" />
<h3>Rights</h3>
<div data-section-style=""7"">

<strong>Offer</strong> a buffet-style meal, this can cut costs on catering staff and create a more sociable environment. Guests are often just as happy with a buffet as they are a full sit down meal as it offers more flexibility and options. Buffet style meals work especially well over breakfast and lunch.

<strong>Focus</strong> on the dessert, even if the main was very average a great dessert is a cheap way to impress guests overall. As a dessert is the final course of the meal, therefore, the final thing which will stay in your guest's minds from catering.

<strong>Offer</strong> a tapas-style selection of foods with drinks rather than a sit-down meal, this will again save on catering costs whilst still leaving guests happy. If you choose to do this make sure the tapas do not require cutlery to eat. Be warned-a common and frustrating catering mistake is serving food which requires a table when accompanying standing networking drinks.

</div>
<h3>Wrongs</h3>
<div data-section-style=""7"">

<strong>Blow</strong> the majority of your budget on fancy decor, as much as everyone enjoys a nice looking room, they will appreciate the event catering more than the decorations. A few flowers and fairy lights can create a great atmosphere at a fraction of the cost from processional event decorators.

<strong>Spend</strong> above your budget on impressive ingredients, don’t sell a $20 attendee ticket whilst promising guests lobster. Guests will be expecting the menu to reflect the price paid for their ticket.

<strong>Sell</strong> more tickets than people you can afford to feed, it is essential you think about both the venue size and your budget here.

<strong>Ignore</strong> your caterer's suggestions to reduce costs- you have hired professionals and they want the guests to be happy just as much as you do! If they suggest serving tea and coffee after dinner they are recommending this from experience not just to make more money from you.

<strong>Make sure</strong> your event caterers are flexible and experts in the field. This is not an area to cut costs down in, using non-professional caterers could cause many problems including poor service, ignoring guests' dietary requirements, food which is cold or poor quality, food which has not been cooked thoroughly, last-minute cancellations and impolite guest interactions.

<strong>Become stressed</strong> over the catering, after planning the caterers will do the work for you so relax and let them do their job.
<h2>Summary</h2>
Whilst Event Catering is fun and exciting it does take a lot of planning and organization. Make sure when planning an event that you pay close attention to all of the above time to avoid the wrongs and enhance the rights.

Of course, each event is individual however with catering there are always general practice elements that must stay the same. Including: keeping to local laws, food safety, not leaving any guests hungry and offering professional service.

If you are planning a large scale event, it may be a good idea to hire an event planner to organize elements such as the event catering. Be warned sometimes things do go wrong so just be sure to keep lighthearted about the situation and always have a backup plan.

Smooth event catering is not what makes an event successful as well. Consider <strong>Booking a Demo</strong> with us today and we'll give you a tour of our end-to-end event management platform that helps make your event run as smooth as possible.

<h3>1. Viral Video Fundraiser</h3>
Remember the ALS ice bucket challenge? There is no reason you can’t try a viral video fundraiser of your own! Get your company employees to participate and share - even if it only takes off in your community, its a free and easy way to collect donations and raise awareness.
<h3>2. Text-to-give</h3>
Make fundraising easy for yourself by embracing the digital age. People find it very easy to interact with organizations via text message, so text-to-give offers a convenient fundraising solution. All you need to do is find a provider able to do the hard work for you, and then all your supporters will need to do is text the amount they wish to donate. Simple!
<h3>3. Crowdfunding</h3>
The king of simple and effective fundraising methods, this modern campaign can both spread awareness of your cause and unite communities in their fundraising efforts. You can source a crowdfunding platform through which to operate, then all you need is a compelling story, engaging photos, and a goal. With these three things ready to go, your online donation page could garner a lot of attention and reach far corners of the internet.
<h3>4. Peer-to-peer Fundraising</h3>
Instead of having to organize your own means of fundraising, your members and supporters volunteer to attract donations! They can choose their own goals, pages, and events and will be responsible for soliciting donors. This will help you retain your current donors while possibly attracting more.
<h3>5. Amazon’s Smile Program</h3>
If you can get your supporters to sign up for <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/"">Amazon Smile</a>, your organization will get 0,5% of each purchase they make. Although it's not a big amount, promoting it won't be a lot of work for your organization and even small amounts will eventually add up!
<h3>6. Shared Photos</h3>
Upload and share photos from an event that attendees can then purchase for a small amount. This is useful for maintaining a fundraising event’s momentum - the proceeds go directly to your organization and people will have gained a valuable or funny momentum of the occasion.

<h3>7. Easter Egg Hunt</h3>
A great excuse to capitalize on the holidays, an easter egg hunt at an event could be fun, engaging and rewarding. Hide mini prizes around a location, or stay even more traditional and just hide easter eggs.
<h3 id=""popsiclestand"">8. Popsicle stand</h3>
Perfect for a hot summer day: buy a bunch of popsicles wholesale and charge at an inflated price, or make your own artisanal popsicles!
<h3 id=""bbq"">9. BBQ</h3>
No summer is complete without one, and what better cause to plan a BBQ than for your next fundraising event! Recruit volunteers to cook, buy burgers, sausages, buns, veggie skewers, and more wholesale and sell them to your guests. These could even be hosted at suitable locations during the colder months, offering a flavor of what's in store for when summer comes back around that could attract customers.
<h3>10. Sausage Sizzle</h3>
An even more sweet but simple concept than the BBQ. Popular with Australian’s, a sausage sizzle is a BBQ where you just sell sausages. These can be held at all times of the year: add lashings of sauce, some fried onions, and bread and set up shop at a popular and busy event.
<h3 id=""hauntedhouse"">11. Haunted House</h3>
It can be really simple to turn any space into a haunted house. Hire actors or even train volunteers act for you and deck out your venue with spooky decorations.
<h3>12. Pumpkin Smash</h3>
Have people donate their old pumpkins instead of throwing them out. Offer protective clothing, goggles, and bats and have people pay to be able to smash a pumpkin! A satisfying way to dispose of the holiday’s waste.
<h3>13. Christmas Tree Recycling</h3>
Charge a fee to dispose of old Christmas trees - if you collect enough you can turn it into a bonfire party with additional fundraising options involved, selling concessions as well as tickets.
<h3>14. Office Decorating Contest</h3>
Give your office a month to decorate an area for Christmas before inviting people to tour through the office paying to vote for their favorite spaces. This could be a great way of involving members on the ground of your organization and letting them see the ins and outs of your organization first hand.
<h3>15. Gingerbread House Making Competition</h3>
Another Christmas favorite! Charge a fee for people to enter a gingerbread house-making competition. The results will make for a magical exhibition that you can charge entry for too, or you could charge $1 per vote in a competition. Prepare a prize for the winner.
<h3>16. Polar Bear Plunge</h3>
Often called simply an Ice Plunge, you can guess from the name what this event entails. These events can be huge, with multiple participants garnering large sponsorship amounts as they take to a body of ice-cold water in winter. Embrace the polar bear in you and plan an ice plunge as an annual fundraising event!
<h3>17. Christmas Decoration Service</h3>
Charge a fee to go to people's houses or offices to decorate them with festive and seasonal decorations.
<h3>18. Gift Wrapping Service</h3>
Offer a gift-wrapping service to people who are overwhelmed by the time-consuming task of wrapping presents at Christmas or other events. A great way for people to offer something to the community for a day and raise some funds.
<h3>19. Valentine's Rose-o-grams</h3>
Allow workers or students to purchase a rose to be sent to somebody anonymously (or not!) nearby on valentine’s day. A kitsch but cute way to make money for your company on Valentine’s day, awwww.

<h3>20. Candy-grams</h3>
As if sending roses wasn’t enough, get even more sickly sweet with candy grams! These could be offered as a romantic gesture, or merely a small pick me up/surprise for somebody.
<h3>21. Red Cup Party</h3>
Throw a party selling cups on the door at an inflated price to be donated to your cause.
<h3>22. Pig Roast</h3>
Have a classic hog roast - a surefire delicious way to raise money that can be done as part of a larger fundraising event or as a stand-alone occasion.
<h3>23. Cookbooks</h3>
Have members of your organization donate favorite recipes to be compiled into a book to sell online or at events.
<h3>24. Meatless Monday Dinner Party</h3>
Throw a dinner party with Meatless Monday as the theme. With what seems like the whole world making a concerted effort to eat less meat, make eating out easy by hosting your own fundraiser vegetarian dinner party. Charge a certain price for the set menu and have volunteers help prepare the food.
<h3>25. Pot Luck</h3>
Very easy to organize and make a profit from! Have people pay an entry fee to a pot luck dinner and pledge to bring a dish with them. Very low cost and should result in an interesting variety of dishes!
<h3>26. Food Fight En Blanc</h3>
Start with a blank slate by dressing all in white and then prepare to get messy with a food fight! There are different options here. You can collect sponsors for a spaghetti food fight, a cream custard fight, a chocolate sauce slip n slide - additionally charge around $5 registration fee and $15 for the slip n slides, and perhaps see if there are any world records you can break in the process!
<h3>27. Themed Afternoon Teas</h3>
Afternoon tea can be a delightful and profitable fundraiser - make it more exciting with an interesting theme. Alice in Wonderland is a popular option bound to attract more ticket sales. Have ‘Eat me’ cake and ‘Drink me’ tea as part of your set menu!
<h3>28. Chili Cook-Off</h3>
Used staggered prices, charging around $15 for early bird entry, $20 for on the door and $30 per competing teams. Spice up your cook-off with other events such as a hottest chili pepper eating contest, fun runs, and more.
<h3 id=""foodtruck"">29. Food Truck Festival</h3>
Hire a plot and invite local food vendors and trucks to sell for a day on behalf of your organization's fundraiser. Charge an entry fee or ask for shares of the truck profits, play music and immerse yourself in foodie heaven.
<h3>30. Bake Sale</h3>
My mouth is watering just thinking about this one! Nothing can go wrong with a bake sale. Have volunteers offer to bake cakes, cookies, muffins, scones, cupcakes, biscuits, pastries, cake pops - everything you can think of - and organize a time and place to sell.
<h3 id=""lemonade"">31. Adult Lemonade Stand</h3>
Your classic lemonade stand but more R rated. Sell cocktails or turn the office into a bar at the end of a workday.
<h3>32. All-Inclusive Pancake Breakfast</h3>
A great option for pancake day enthusiasts. Collect toppings, make a LOT of batter, and recruit volunteers to help flip at an all-inclusive pancake breakfast. Sell all-inclusive tickets to cover costs and make as much money as possible.
<h3>33. Winery Tour/ Brewery Tour/ Distillery Tour</h3>
Wine/beer/gin tasting are exceptionally popular events. With vineyards, brewers, and distilleries always looking to promote their products, finding sponsorship for the fundraiser should be relatively easy. Like other events, the popularity of the experience could draw in people from outside your supporter base and so grow this base. Combine with a few other fundraising options, such as raffles or auctions - a <a href=""#wineorbeerpull""><b>wine or beer pull raffle</b></a> is an especially good option here. You will make a profit from the ticket sales but should organize with the merchant you partner with to receive a percentage of the sales of the product they manage to sell through the event.
<h3>34. Bar Crawl</h3>
Sell tickets for a pub crawl! See if you can get venues onboard to subsidize the cost of the drinks; partnering with various venues for this could attract more patrons for the various venues on the crawl. With the extra publicity you could ask for a share of the profits made during the event, or at least place a <b>fish tank</b> there to collect small change donations.

<h3>35. Beer Run</h3>
Food and drink-related but moving into sports territory now: a beer run is a more intense version of a bar crawl where participants run between the locations. Sell tickets to prospective beer runners and the competitive/long-distance run element should allow your participants to collect sponsorship too, maximizing the returns for your fundraiser!
<h3>36. Stair Climbing Tournament</h3>
Have fundraisers pledge to climb a certain amount of steps in a day, or have people donate $1 per 10 steps or so - then find a tall enough public building to accommodate for this challenge, and put your fundraisers to work until they have fulfilled the donation pledge.
<h3>37. 10,000 Steps Challenge</h3>
Have volunteers pledge to walk over 10,000 steps a day for a certain amount of time and collect sponsorship for this period.
<h3>38. Sponsored Skydive</h3>
Perfect for thrill-seekers or those who want to test their boundaries a little with the excuse of donating to a good cause. Participants usually pay for the skydive themselves and fundraise on your behalf by collecting sponsorship. Recruit a handful of volunteers and make a day of it.
<h3>39. Sponsored Abseil</h3>
Less hardcore than a skydive but still a little out of the comfort zone, a sponsored abseil can also be a great activity to have volunteers fundraise on your behalf.
<h3>40. Board Game Tournament</h3>
To cut costs, have people bring their own board games for a night of competition and games! Provide snacks and beverages to keep up stamina. Charge guests to participate with either an entry fee or a small amount per game.
<h3>41. Bingo Night</h3>
A golden oldie but a classic nonetheless. Charge per game and have sponsors or businesses contribute to a variety of prizes or one large prize.
<h3>42. 5k Race</h3>
Sponsored races, walks, marathons, cycling events - all are handy ways to earn money for your cause. Allow people to collect sponsorship donations months in advance to ensure large profits.
<h3>43. Dog Walk</h3>
Like a sponsored 5k but with man’s best friend as your companion! Time will fly at a sponsored dog walk, and money will pour in from those sponsors. Plus, your pup will get more than their daily portion of exercise.
<h3>44. Themed Yoga Classes</h3>
Put a spin on a traditional yoga class, making it appealing even to inflexible, exercise-phobes! Encourage participation and raise funds with your one-off yoga event - cute animal visitors, beer and chicken nuggets are three things that have been incorporated into yoga classes before and can make your event appeal to all kinds of people.
<h3>45. Activity Marathon</h3>
An activity marathon - such as a 24-hour dance-a-thon - is an ideal option for collecting sponsors. Live streaming the event can show the effort put in for the donations as well as giving a live counter of the money raised to encourage more on the day donations.
<h3>46. Rock - Paper - Scissors tournament</h3>
Or Roshambo! Charge a lot of people a small amount to enter a roshambo contest and try their luck to win a grand prize. Does it come down to chance? Psychology? Who knows but by throwing a roshambo event you can get multiple people engaged.
<h3>47. Golf Tournament</h3>
Solicit donors and sponsorship for an all-day golf tournament fundraiser. Some tips for maximizing your profits:
1. Host a golf-a-thon by finding a number of golfers to raise pledges for each hole. Depending on how many holes there are, you can raise a lot of money this way!
2. Put a local golf pro or celebrity with each foursome and raise your ticket or registration price
3. Find a great venue - golfers will be more willing to pay for a club course they don’t ordinarily have access to.
<h3>48. Ping Pong Tournament</h3>
Charge an entry fee for your participants to play in your ping pong tournament. Make sure that your prizes reflect your entry fee. A better prize means you can charge a higher registration fee! Just make sure you have the basics - ping pong tables (you could ask for community members to lend them), paddles and balls - and you’re good to go!
<h3>49. Field Day</h3>
Otherwise known as a Sports day. Organize a day of events for adults or families to participate in. Obstacle courses, egg throws, egg and spoon races, sack races, and the tug of war are all classic events people can sign up for. Charge a registration fee and maybe even turn it into your own mini Olympics fundraiser!
<h3>50. Workout Class Fundraiser</h3>
Raise money and pulses with a workout class fundraiser - ask a local instructor to donate their time for a class and get sweating!
<h3>51. Bowl-a-thon</h3>
Solicit prizes from local businesses and sponsors and allow for more engagement from participants by organizing a group or team event like a bowl-a-thon. This can be a senior event, for the children of your associates and donors, or completely family-friendly allowing you to tailor it to ensure you reach whatever fundraising goal you set.
<h3>52. Family Friendly Mud Run</h3>
Double the mess, double the fun of a regular race. Share sponsorship forms early and don’t forget to have a bath waiting at home for all those messy kids! You could even recruit the local fire department to help shower everyone off at the end.
<h3>53. Marathon</h3>
Have volunteers apply to run a marathon on behalf of your organization!

<h3>54. Theatre Performance</h3>
Put on a show or arrange for some of the shares of the profits of a show to go to your cause. Collaborate with your local theatre group or simply plan your own. The families and friends of your organization's members could get a kick out of seeing their loved ones put on an amateur performance and maybe you’ll even discover some talent in the process.
<h3>55. Drawing Auction</h3>
Recruit people to spend a day doing some creative artwork and sell the pieces at the end of the day! This could be an excellent way to exhibit fresh talent and allow budding artists to get credit for their work while supporting your organization.
<h3>56. Fashion Show</h3>
Ask volunteers who won’t be afraid to strut their stuff on the catwalk to participate in a fashion show. Local designers and business owners can get involved for a chance to highlight their talent and partner with your cause. Sell tickets and if your designers plan to collect orders after the event, request a small commission to be donated to your cause.
<h3>57. Photo Exhibition</h3>
Invite local photographers and artists, amateur and professional alike, to exhibit their work at your fundraiser. Charge a small entry fee and see if you can collaborate with the artists to allow a commission to be donated on any artwork sold. This is a great way to offer artists a space to exhibit their work while raising money for your cause.
<h3>58. Create One-of-a-kind Pieces to Sell</h3>
Ask local artists to contribute art pieces or create yourself if you are a creator/inventor. You have the option to either set up a physical store or take commissions for pieces.
<h3>59. Art Auction</h3>
Another means to showcase local talent, request donations from the creative community to be sold at a charity art auction. You could even ask for commissioned pieces for your cause, or suggest to go 50/50 on the profits made from a work. Curate a collection and let the bidding begin.
<h3>60. Film Screening</h3>
Score a projector and an open space and you’re well suited to host your own film screening. Fill the space with comfy cushions, buy and sell microwavable popcorn at around $2 a cup and sell tickets for a private screening of your choice. This event can be either big or small, from large old school drive-ins to cozy, intimate rooftop screenings.
<h3>61. Battle of the Bands</h3>
Invite local musicians to compete in a battle of the bands! Allowing up and coming talent a space to perform for a large crowd will invite acts to complete your headline. Charge a small entry fee per band, have a prize ready for the winners and runners up, and then sell tickets to the community, spreading the word about your event online, via social media and with flyers.

<h3>62. Treasure Hunt</h3>
To make things a bit more difficult, turn your easter egg hunt into a treasure hunt with clues leading to one large prize or reward. The clues or questions can be related to your organization at times, or simply a series of riddles made to challenge the hunters. Teams or individuals can pay to take part and you can be creative with the prize. Additionally, a treasure hunt can be done at any time of the year and the location doesn’t matter too much!
<h3>63. Quiz Night</h3>
Trivia nights or the humble ‘pub-quiz’ are easy to organize. There are a host of example questions and categories online, and you can even tailor questions to reflect the interests of your organization. Offer prizes for the winner and runner up, and charge an entrance fee for a night of competition and fun.
<h3 id=""piethrowing"">64. Pie Throwing Contest</h3>
It’s never a bad day for some pie... in the face! Use pie tins filled with either shaving foam or whipped cream. Pick people who are active in your community or organization and people with strong personalities. For a one day event, place the volunteers behind a face-in-the-hole board and have guests pay to aim their pies at the face. For an event lasting a few days, pit five or so participants against each other, having attendees and participants alike pay to place votes on who should be pied on stage. You can also send out ballots before the event to maximize profits. Have a board showing the progress of the ballots, but take this down on the last day of the event so only the organizers know the standings - this will help encourage participants and attendees to purchase more ballots as they know where they last stood in the race, but not their current progress! Count the votes on stage with the participants seated and announce the third-place winner, runner up and the winner and recipient of the pie to build tension. Then pie them!
<h3>65. Beard Competition</h3>
One for the men - no shave November or ‘Movember’ has proven a popular and successful way of raising money in aid of men’s health awareness. But why not host your own beard competition at any time of the year? Tell participants a few months in advance and have them style their growths for a contest. Sponsorship collected over a couple of months would be a great pot to add to your cause, and you could make the day of the competition an event in itself charging $1 to vote for favorite beards, hosting a raffle, or more.
<h3>66. Bake Off</h3>
A British favorite that has caught the attention of the wider world, hosting your own bake-off is the perfect way to indulge in some friendly and delicious competition. You could try and organize high profile stars to be the bakers, or even just office BNOC’s (big name on campus), charge entry, and charge people per vote for their favorites to win
<h3>67. Masterchef</h3>
Challenge event attendees to become their own Masterchefs in the same competition style layout as bake-off - you can challenge each participant to make a large portion so that event attendees can each try the dish and decide
<h3>68. Penny Wars</h3>
A simple event, place several tanks at a location and encourage people to donate their pennies. Add the competitive element by assigning some character or theme to each tank to see which gets filled first. But there’s a twist! $1 cancels out 100 pennies. The group with most pennies at the end of the period wins.
<h3>69. Beer Pong Tournament</h3>
A beer pong tournament where players pay to enter the game and play for a shot at glory (and a prize) harks back to college dorm days. Up the stakes and have people sponsor players in a <a href=""https://fearponggame.com/"">fear pong tournament</a>, where a dare is placed under each cup and the cup can be saved if the dare is fulfilled.
<h3>70. Poker Tournament</h3>
A little friendly competition can raise the profile of an event with cash buy-ins and a cash prize. Sell tickets, snacks, and drinks, combine with one of the raffle events and watch as players gamble away the night for a worthy cause.

<h2 id=""Unique"">Unique Fundraising Ideas</h2>
<h3>71. Open House</h3>
Invite people into your organization and see what happens behind scenes - buying tickets to a tour can allow people to feel involved at ground level. Equally, collaborating with a local landmark or venue that isn’t ordinarily accessible to the public to offer VIP tour or experience tickets where you take a share of the revenue made could work.
<h3>72. Parents’ Party</h3>
Offer to watch the kids while the parents have a party. Give your parent members a night off, without having to worry about childcare and bedtime. You can collaborate with local businesses/restaurants so that the parents can have a date night there, making it even easier to get parents on board.
<h3>73. Pet Picture Day</h3>
Ask a local photographer to donate time and set up a ‘studio’ at your organization - invite pet owners to come and have their pictures taken!
<h3>74. Rubix Cube Party</h3>
Like any fundraising party, charge a set price for tickets in order to make a profit. Having a fun theme for your party makes it even more appealing and heightens your chances of selling tickets. At a Rubix cube party, arrive wearing all the colors of a Rubix cube and trade items of clothing at the party until you are all one color. Prizes for those who complete the activity in the shortest amount of time.
<h3>75. Teacher/Boss in Jail Fundraiser</h3>
Elect someone to put in ‘jail’ for the day - usually a boss or teacher - and charge $1 per minute to keep them there. The person elected can get work done in jail while allowing employees or colleagues the chance to work unsupervised.
<h3>76. Baby Photo Contest</h3>
Have members or colleagues bring in baby photos and pin them onto a board - charge a small amount for people to place votes such as ‘funniest looking’, ‘chubbiest’ or ‘best baby style’. Equally, you could introduce a competition for matching the baby photos with the adult photos - offer a prize for the person who gets the most answers correct the fastest.
<h3>77. Pennies from Heaven</h3>
Instead of simply dropping change into a container, donors toss change into an upside-down umbrella hanging from the ceiling. You could try to organize this as a permanent installation somewhere public and create a quirky, artistic and fun way to donate small change.
<h3>78. Morning Dance Party</h3>
Struggling to beat those morning blues? A morning dance party can be the perfect way to get some energy flowing for the day ahead. Unusual events like these can draw a crowd, and what’s a better feel-good boost than an energizing dance party for a good cause?
<h3>79. Dare Fundraiser</h3>
Have people pledge to fulfill dares once a certain donation threshold has been reached. Invent more extreme dares for different thresholds. These can be exceptionally creative and weird, just use your imagination! If you need a push in the right direction, consider these:
<ul>
 	<li>Dare pledges to spend a day in public in fancy dress</li>
 	<li>Dare pledges to let someone style their hair in whatever way they want - cutting, shaving, and dyeing won't be off-limits!</li>
</ul>
<h3>80. Multicultural/International Fair</h3>
Selling tickets to a multicultural or international fair can be a wonderful way to bring the community together. Ask members from the local community to host their own stalls representing their home countries or family heritage, selling multicultural foods, drinks, products, and services (think Latin cuisine, german wood ornaments, henna painting for example). Stage traditional dances, musical performances and shows and invite guests to attend in traditional outfits. The resulting fundraising event will be a magical celebration of diversity and culture.
<h3>81. Arcade Game Night</h3>
For a Throwback Thursday, rent a handful of arcade machines and charge people inflated prices to come and play. Offer arcade-style snacks - hotdogs, fries, nachos - and enjoy a nostalgic night of fundraising.

For a more novelty and risqué item, you can opt for the nude calendar (or nearly nude - suggestively cover ‘bits’ with beach balls, candy canes, pumpkins, etc.); having your members or colleagues get involved in this can be a hilarious way to raise money.
<h3>86. Buy-a-brick Fundraiser</h3>
Allow supporters to buy and have their name engraved on a brick-built into a new structure. This is perfect for companies that are raising money to build or renovate a community-building, inviting supporters to share in the excitement of a project while raising money for that project and others.

Have people bring in old books to be sold or swapped, making the most of that house clutter and repurposing beloved copies while raising money.

Source a desirable prize and sell items with a special ‘golden ticket’ hidden inside - Willy Wonka Style! something you would want to win in a raffle, such as a holiday, experience, $500 gift-card, etc. Hide multiple prizes to maintain interest in purchasing the items. You can go for the traditional chocolate bar or something more in line with your organization's interests.
<h3>89. Greeting Cards</h3>
Have your organization design its own greetings cards for sale to the general public. Offer a unique and lovely alternative for the hallmark seasons to be sold at all events or via an online store or social media channels.

<h3>90. Reverse Raffle</h3>
In a reverse raffle, it is the last number drawn that wins the grand prize rather than the first! Watch excitement for your event build with the tension as you get closer and closer to that grand prize. Set a fixed number of tickets, and offer either a substantial donated prize or a share of the ticket profits (for example, 100 tickets at $100 grosses a $5,000 prize and $5,000 for your organization). Make it a party with some food, drink, music, and games and draw numbers throughout the night.
<h3>91. Mentorship Auction</h3>
Bidding for one-to-one chat sessions with thought leaders or participating celebrities - conversations can happen remotely online if necessary making it very easy to organize.
<h3>92. Silent Auction</h3>
Solicit valuable prizes to auction off from supporters, donors and local businesses then host a silent auction during an event. Simply place sign up sheets by the item or description of the item and allow people to outbid themselves throughout the evening. Experience and holiday prizes, hampers, gift cards, and high-value items are all favorites for a silent auction.
<h3>93. Date Auction</h3>
Have volunteers offer a night for a date to be bid on by your event attendees. All you need are some willing, outgoing participants to offer their time. You can even get some celebrities involved to make the bidding more exciting and hopefully competitive.
<h3>94. IOU Auction</h3>
Auction off cheques written by volunteers entailing IOU’s to be exchanged for some sort of service - this could range from offering to do someones laundry for a month, cleaning houses for a month, mowing lawns for a month to more specific services such as massages, haircuts, and private fitness instructions.
<h3>95. 50/50 Raffle</h3>
Sell a large number of raffle tickets and put the money into a pot that will be split 50/50 between your winner and the organization! The more tickets sold and the higher the price the higher the prize and the donation respectively.
<h3 id=""wineorbeerpull"">96. Drinks Pull Raffle</h3>
Give people the opportunity to walk away with a bottle of top-quality wine or beer with a drinks pull raffle! Wrap the respective wine and beer bottles so that their labels are covered, and allow people to purchase a bottle. They will then blindly choose from the selection which bottle they would like - all go home with a bottle and you raise money for your fundraiser, win-win!
<h3>97. Best Seat in the House Fundraiser</h3>

<h3>99. Write Letters Asking for Donations</h3>
A simple but effective means of fundraising: asking your partners/members/affiliates or whoever else you can think of who might be interested to donate to your organization with a written letter. Reaching out can sometimes be the easiest way.
<h3>100. Casual Day</h3>
Allow for ‘Casual Fridays’ in the office for a small fee on a regular basis to have a steady flow of donations coming in to support your cause. People can opt-in whenever they feel like.
<h3>101. Pajama Day</h3>
As if Casual Day wasn’t exciting enough - up the ante with pajama day! The same concept but maybe a harder sell to an office full of adults.

Give your organization members, family, and friends a chance to dress to impress at your charity ball. Book a classy venue, decor, and caterer to vamp up your event and add a mandatory donation to each ticket price to ensure high returns for your organization. You could combine this with a silent auction or raffle fundraiser to maximize your profits!
<h3>103. Black Tie Buffet/BBQ</h3>
Think budget ball. The same black tie dress code, but with a more budget-friendly cost. Low-cost food and decor cut down the need for extravagant expenses whilst maintaining the allure of sophistication.

Host this event well into the night without having to worry about noise complaints! Take a portion of the ticket sales, sell concessions to up your profits and boogie the night away.

Raise the stakes with an entire casino night of gambling. Hire slot machines, play cards, get a roulette table, and offer cocktail. You could additionally suggest a theme for a real 007 feel.
<h3>108. Ugly Sweater Party</h3>
People could pay $1 or so to place votes on the ugliest sweaters, earning your organization money on top of an entrance fee.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-788 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1623"" height=""1080"" />
<h3 id=""balloon"">109. Balloon Fundraiser</h3>
There are many ways to play a balloon fundraiser, and it is easy to upscale, making it an efficient and effective fundraising idea. Fill a room with however many balloons you want and hide pieces of paper in the balloons offering prizes. Ensure each balloon has something inside so you can’t tell which ones have the big prizes and then sell pins with which to pop the balloons! The players get to claim the prize on the slip of paper. Up the prizes and up the costs of the pins accordingly. You can even make it more fun by having people throw darts at a balloon board. The room itself will be picture perfect and the satisfying pop of the balloon bursts will entice crowds to take part in the fundraiser.
<h3>110. Chauffeur for a Day</h3>
Ask volunteers to give up their time to act as a personal chauffeur service! Whether you need a designated driver so you can enjoy Happy Hour a bit more, or you simply want to live in the lap of luxury for a while, who could turn this down as a potential raffle or auction prize? Organizations can also choose to have this as a stand-alone option, offering a day for their supporters to opt-in for the personal chauffeur service.
<h3>111. Haircut</h3>
Ask local hairdressers to donate a day or so of their time for your fundraiser. Have people donate a certain amount for each cut and add whatever value they believe is reflective of the cut.
<h3>112. Car Wash</h3>
A fundraising classic. Charge a certain amount per car and recruit a host of volunteers to wash the cars.
<h3>113. Dog Wash</h3>
Invite the local dog-owning community to a community dog wash! Charge a reasonable amount and have some volunteers prepared to spend all day pampering pretty pooches and getting covered in dog kisses!
<h3 id=""dunktank"">114. Dunk Tank</h3>
Find volunteers who don’t mind getting a little wet and who are potentially large targets for being dunked by their coworkers/employees! Set up a dunk tank at your event and charge for sponges to be aimed at the target. With some tanks costing approximately $200 for 6 hours, you’re bound to make a profit.
<h3>115. Kick the Habit</h3>
Called a ‘give-it-up’ fundraiser, this idea combines fundraising with turning over a new leaf. Have people sign up to donate money that they would have spent on a habit or indulgence that they have given up for the duration of the fundraiser. Participants could additionally increase their fundraising profits by having sponsors support them to achieve their goal!
<h3>116. Envelope Fundraiser</h3>
Buy a pack of 100 envelopes and number each one, then stick them to a pin-board numbered 1-100. Allow people to choose which envelope they want to donate to. This pin-board can be left in the office, put up at an event or put in a safe public space.
<h3 id=""guessinggames"">117. Guessing Games</h3>
This can be applied to so many things. Charge people to guess the number of sweets in a jar to win the jar. At Christmas time you could make a gingerbread house and have people guess the number of sweets on the house to win it. Or you could simply offer a prize for someone to guess the correct number of beads in a jar. Supersize this for a more captivating game.
<h3>118. Fish-tank-funds</h3>
So simple you’ll kick yourself for not already having one. Buy or even ask for a donation of an old fish tank. Place the tank somewhere in a public space with permission, and see how long it takes to fill up with change. you can place targets on the tank if you would like to encourage people to donate towards certain goals.
<h3 id=""facepainting"">119. Face Painting</h3>
Hire a kid's face painter and even have some adult options available so everyone can get in on the fun.
<h3>120. Meal with a Celebrity</h3>
Ask a local celebrity (for example the mayor, popular athlete, local artist or entrepreneur) to donate a few hours to have a meal with a raffle or auction winner. You could even ask a local restaurant to offer the meal for free in return for a visit from the celebrity and publicity.
<h3>121. Junk Donations</h3>
Ink cartridges, batteries, old magazines, defunct electronics, etc. Have people donate these things they won’t miss so you can raise money.
<h3>122. Call Sprint</h3>
Tell members or affiliates of your association beforehand that you are going to hold a call sprint for a certain period of time on a certain date. Gather a group of volunteers to then call the members and affiliates and ask for donations, live streaming the event so the progress can be monitored - setting a goal can help encourage potential donors to dig deep in support of your organization!
<h3>123. Garage Sale/ Car Boot Sale</h3>
Get people to donate old clothes/homewares/shoes/tech that’s in good condition and sell it on! One point for recycling and another for fundraising.
<h3>124. Donation Match Drive</h3>
Source partners with local businesses willing to match all donations made at an event to double your profits!

<h3>125. Carnival</h3>
Throw your own carnival! This can last over a weekend if you want it to, with a series of events taking place each day to attract hoards of visitors. You can incorporate some of your favorite fundraising ideas into this to maximize your profits. This will take a while to plan but can be a valuable fundraising opportunity, enticing your current supporters/members and more to join in on the fun. Hire fairground rides, food trucks and put on a performance or hold a talent show. There are endless opportunities for how to put on a carnival best suited to raising some proper dough - choose what is best for you and start planning months in advance for the event of the year! (Our suggestions for the best fundraising ideas to accompany your carnival are <b><a href=""#balloon"">Balloon Fundraisers</a>, <a href=""#facepainting"">Kid’s Face Painting</a>, <a href=""#guessinggames"">Guessing Games</a>, <a href=""#wineorbeerpull"">Drinks Pull Raffle</a>, <a href=""#piethrowing"">Pie Throwing Contest</a>, <a href=""#dunktank"">Dunk Tank</a>, <a href=""#lemonade"">Adult Lemonade Stand</a>, <a href=""#foodtruck"">Food Truck Festival</a>, <a href=""#popsiclestand"">Popsicle Stand</a>, <a href=""#bbq"">BBQ</a>, </b>and <b><a href=""#hauntedhouse"">Haunted House.</a></b>
<h3>126. Comedy Night</h3>
Everyone likes a laugh, so why not throw your own comedy night in aid of your organization? Invite local talent or people from the comedy circuit to participate in your comedy night fundraiser. Sell tickets to cover the cost of the comedians or ask them to donate their fees to your organization. You could partner with a local restaurant to have them offer the space as a venue, whilst they can profit from the revenue of the patrons by selling food and drink during the event.
<h3>127. Karaoke</h3>
Offering the chance to belt out a few bangers, karaoke is an optimum fundraising event. Recruit some energetic and willing singers (and some not so willing participants), find yourself a karaoke machine, get some drinks and snacks and sing yourself towards your goal.
<h3>128. Lip Sync Competition</h3>
For those who are microphone shy put on a lip-syncing competition. Participants can pay to enter and get the chance to showcase their performance skills AND claim a prize for the best performance. You could even include small prizes for different categories, such as best dressed, best dancer, best Cher impression, etc. Charge a base fee for entry to maximize your fundraising potential.
<h3>129. Car Show</h3>
Set up a car show to raise money in a few different ways. Motor enthusiasts will pay to exhibit and display their cars, and to see others. You can also add on raffles, prize drawings, food and drink stands on the day to maximize donations. Consider charging participants a fee to vote for their favorite car(s), and then present “People’s Choice” awards to the exhibition
<h3>130. Serve-a-thon Event</h3>
Raise money while doing something good for your community! Collect donations from the local community by offering to pick litter. Have local residents or businesses pledge a certain amount per item of trash recycled/cleared - for example, 1 aluminum can = $1
<h3>131. Speed Dating</h3>
For all those singletons, hosting a speed dating event is easy to facilitate and fun to do. Charge for entry, offer a cozy space with drinks and snacks, and let the sparks fly.
<h3>132. Sky Lantern Send-Off</h3>
Another activity that can be made into an event itself. Offer sky lanterns to be purchased and then organize a clear evening to release them. Encourage people to bring a picnic on a balmy night or offer your own food options at an inflated price as another means to raise money for your cause.
<h3>133. Open Mic Night</h3>
This could attract local talent keen to showcase their performance, or simply individuals looking to have a good time. Charge entry to your venue and perhaps an admin fee for each band or artist wanting to participate, and host your own charity gig!

<h2 id=""journey"">Create a Membership Experience Journey Map</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-11224 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/insights.jpg"" alt=""member journey map to improve membership experience"" width=""1204"" height=""1080"" />

Create a member journey map this will allow you to take a walk in your member's shoes. It is a way to visualize your member's needs, emotions and expectations of your association. This will create a great base to begin improving your membership experience. This mapping process is made up of 4 main goals which are:

<b>Insights</b>

You can gain an idea of your member's needs and wants from the association. Think about what is it that made them sign up in the first place?

<b>Issues and opportunities  </b>

Discover what issues your members currently have, what is it that is stopping them from having a better experience? you can then directly address this and improve the experience.

<strong>Innovation </strong>

Come up with new and unique ideas and experiences to resolve your member's issues.

<b>Impact </b>

This is the results the changes had on your association, how they have benefited your members and how they have created a positive business impact?
<h2 id=""outreach"">Reaching Out to Your Members</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3035"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/email-3249062_1280.png"" alt=""association management software automation"" width=""1280"" height=""716"" />

Try reaching out to your association members when they first join the membership. When you reach out, tell them about all the different features and benefits which your membership offers. This is a way to decrease drop out rates. This is because a large reason people do not renew their association memberships is that they do not know how to fully use the benefits.

Begin by reaching out to members in the first 24 hours that they join the organization, you are able to do this in the format of a mass email. After the mass email tries using more personal communications when reaching out to members. Online communities, phone calls, emails, and letters are all different ways to contact your association members.
<h2 id=""technology"">Build or Improve Your Technology Plan</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-171 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/helloquence-61189.jpg"" alt=""building technology plan improve member experience"" width=""1618"" height=""1080"" />

Using technology correctly is a way to create a ‘seamless’ user experience. Overall this leads to an increase in user satisfaction. However, putting this plan in place requires detailed planning. Think about the following:

<b>Why</b> <b>are you doing it?</b>

Is it to create another element to the membership? create more user engagement?

<b>What</b> <b>will you need to do to deliver the user experience?</b>

This is the features which you will put together in the technology strategy for a particular outcome.

<b>How</b> <b>you are going to tell if the plan was successful? </b>

This depends on your key objectives, for example, you may want to increase your membership renewals by 20% throughout the year.

<b>What</b> <b>is the timeline? </b>

If you set yourself a deadline to achieve your goals the success of your technology plan will be easier to measure.

<b>Who will be creating and maintaining the plan?</b>

This could be one person who is solely responsible or a group of your association team working together on the plan.
<h2 id=""webinars"">Include Webinars in Your Association Experience Benefits</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-441 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/webinar-context1.jpeg"" alt=""improving customer experience benefits webinar"" width=""1440"" height=""1080"" />

Webinars are a great way to engage association members with your organization along with being a great way to increase organizational learning.

When hosting a webinar it is important to ensure that it fits the context. Get thinking about what insights your members joined the association for. Next, pick a topic which is likely to cover the majority of these insights. In addition to educating members, webinars can also help boost the association's community as webinars allow members to interact with each other by opening an online discussion and asking questions.

Try out sites like <a href=""https://www.anymeeting.com/"">Any Meeting</a> and <a href=""https://www.gotomeeting.com/en-gb/webinar"">G</a><a href=""https://www.gotomeeting.com/en-gb/webinar"">oToWebinar</a> to host your webinars through.
<h2 id=""experiences"">Include Experiences in Your Association Membership</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-265 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/networking-event-e1495422285915.jpg"" alt=""event networking rather than tools improving member experience"" width=""1024"" height=""481"" />

According to <a href=""https://www.eventmarketer.com/reports/"">EventMarketer’s brand survey</a> 67% of marketers believe that experiential marketing is a good strategy. This means even though career tools are beneficial it is possible to substitute some of these tools for experiences. Experiences can develop learning further than nonexperience learning. Experiences also remain in the memory longer, therefore, they can create better value benefit for your association members.

By creating career experiences you are forming an additional supplement to the career tools already offered by your association.
<h2 id=""communication"">Strengthen Your Association's Communication</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-11227 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/association-online-networking.jpg"" alt=""Women communicating to association online improving member experience"" width=""1050"" height=""700"" />

Associations begin with the theory that a group of like-minded people with similar interests will join to have intellectual conversations with each other. However, it is surprising that often networking opportunities are not being offered by associations meaning members are often missing out on these interactions.

One way to incorporate communications between members is through a program called <a href=""https://line.me/en/"">Line</a>, members can use this as an online platform to message, voice and video call each other. Line can also be used to send messages directly to the association to answer any questions and engage with comments members may have.

This extra element of communication will enhance membership experience within the association.
<h2 id=""personalization"">Integrate Personalization in Your Membership Engagement</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-11228 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/personalised-mail.jpg"" alt=""letter with personal information to improve membership experience"" width=""474"" height=""356"" />

A way to interact in a more in-depth manner with your association members is by sending out personalized content which is relevant to them. This could include recommended courses, events and job opportunities where relevance can be included through data capture.

On top of this when communicating to members try not to send out mass communications, instead, try to add a personal feel. For example, this can be done through adding members names to messages or sending out event communications such as happy birthday messages and rewards.

This also is true for email campaigns. Using <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/membership-retention-strategies/"">emails campaigns in combination with a CRM</a>, you're able to personalize each email using tags that personalize each email to the name, company, time zone, country, and more so that each recipient feels they've been sent something that's hand-crafted, but in reality is just a single copy that you drafted.
<h2 id=""partners"">Team Up with Partners</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-11230 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/partnership-creation-1.jpg"" alt=""Team up partner to improve member experience "" width=""750"" height=""500"" />

Two parties can create a partnership deal where members receive discounts from each other if signed up to the other party. This creates benefits both for the members by offering them additional benefits from their membership. But also for the association as a whole. The partnership will create a form of additional advertising thereby driving more potential members to your association.
<h2 id=""emotions"">Pay Attention to Your Members' Emotions</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-5919"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/assoc-member-grow-blog@2x.png"" alt=""light bulb emotions"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Every time a new member joins your association they have emotions behind the action. This remains the case whether they have joined for self-development or through work. For example, is the new member happy and optimistic about their new membership and the value they will receive? Or is the new joiner apprehensive around what they will gain from the membership and if their time and money are worth it?

As there is a chance the new member is feeling the latter this is something that associations have to address. Try doing this through different methods like a smooth and informative onboarding process, a frequent steam of communications and by making sure the member has found value in the initial communications offered.

If you find members are still experiencing pain points the association must find the root cause and address the issues.  If the pain points can be solved members will remain happy with their membership. This means they will continue to be part of the association. For example, a member may be worrying that the materials sent are irrelevant. In this circumstance, you can send them more personalized communications tailored to their interests.
<h2 id=""why"">Discover Why Your Members Joined (and double up on it)</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3126"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/webdesign-3411373_1920.jpg"" alt=""event website builder"" width=""1620"" height=""1080"" />

Everyone in your association joined for a reason. Was it because they had a problem they believed the association would solve? to gain more education on the membership topic? or to gain a certification? Find out what their reason is. Once you know this you can keep addressing that reason with personalized communications, therefore, ensuring the member gains full potential from your association. If they feel the association is adding benefits to their lives they are sure to renew their membership.

In practice, by using some of the strategies above to improve membership experience it is possible to put your association in a much stronger position for membership renewal. It is important to keep both the organization's purpose and members interests at heart. By combining these you can create a foolproof system for top association membership experience.

11108,"33 Tips for Chamber Email Marketing that Attracts and Retains Members","Chamber email marketing is effective, efficient and, with our top tips for email marketing strategies, easy too. Even in a world where it may feel like social media reigns king, email is still working its magic driving more conversions than any other marketing channel, including search and social. <a href=""https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2018/12/70-email-marketing-stats-you-need-to-know/"">72% of people prefer to receive promotional content through email rather than social media, and email is 40 times more effective at acquiring new customers than Facebook or Twitter.</a>

But with changes and advancements in the digital sphere happening all the time navigating email marketing can be a demanding task. Adjustments made by Google and Apple, for example, are heavily impacting open rates and unsubscribes. In a bid to remove junk emails from your inbox, Gmail launched Smart Unsubscribe, which offers users the chance to unsubscribe from promotional emails they haven’t opened in 30+ days.

Furthermore, Artificial Intelligence is dramatically altering chamber marketing as Gmail’s machine-learning AI bundles promotional emails by theme or topic. These technological advances alongside generations’ expectations for digital communications to be simple, relevant and easy mean when it comes to email marketing dropping the ball can risk losing subscribers.

According to Loren McDonald, Marketing Evangelist at IBM Marketing Cloud, <a href=""https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/222904/revisiting-email-address-churn.html"">10% to 25%</a> of subscribers completely disengage from a brand's email campaigns annually - and the threat doesn't stop there. The <strong>consequences your chamber risks</strong> by having an ineffective email marketing campaign include:

<strong>An affected sender reputation</strong>. Having inactive subscribers or a low sender score can cause more of your emails to land in the spam folder.

<strong>Skewed data.</strong> Inactive subscribers interfere with your data which can cause you to make incorrect marketing decisions.
<p id=""top"">So how do we mitigate these risks and ensure an effective email marketing strategy? The answer is threefold:</p>

<ol>
 	<li><b>Have </b><b>an </b><b>effective </b><b>onboarding </b><b>strategy</b><b> for </b><b>new </b><b>members</b><b>.</b></li>
 	<li><b>Maintain your subscriber’s interests. </b></li>
 	<li><b>Re-energize.</b></li>
</ol>
The rest of our blog will focus on elaborating 33 tips within this tripartite strategy you can use to optimize your chamber email marketing.

<h2 id=""onboarding"">Onboarding Successfully with Your Chamber Email Marketing</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-2169"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/international_2.jpg"" alt=""welcoming/onboarding members"" width=""1920"" height=""673"" />

Onboarding is an essential step to catching and holding the attention of your members with emails. Brand <i>new</i> members are the warmest and the most receptive. They are more likely to renew their membership if they feel from the outset that they have been welcomed.

Launch your email marketing strategy for new members successfully so as to ignite their interest from the beginning. Starting off with a strong onboarding email campaign will fan the flames of your success and get the fire going that you will have to nurture throughout their membership. Here are our top tips for successful onboarding strategies.
<h2 id=""personalization""><b>Personalization</b></h2>
You should remember when welcoming new members to your chamber that the more personal their introduction, the more comfortable they will be settling in. Emails are essential but keep in mind you want to use this technology to support personally welcoming new members, not to replace it. People want exclusivity and relevance rather than generic content, so targeted marketing and personalization will come up time and time again.
<h2 id=""sendername""><b>Sender Name </b></h2>
In a bid to maintain a consistent personal touch, use a recognizable sender name and email address, sent from a person rather than the organization itself. This is preferable as it offers a face for your chamber and organization rather than reducing it to an automaton.

The sender name will dramatically impact open rates so sending the email with a real person’s name (e.g. Sophia from EventBank) will help prompt recipients to open the message. Consider having the same person who sends the welcome emails at your events so that new members feel as though they already '“know” at least someone there.
<h2 id=""topicandfrequency""><b>Topic and Frequency</b></h2>
Divulge in your first emails how many communications the new subscriber can expect to receive from you, what kind of communications these will be, and how frequently they will come. Allow your members the option to choose these factors so that they only receive a volume they are comfortable keeping up with.

This kind of transparency will be appreciated in the long run. New members will appreciate your chamber reaching out to get to know their interests and be more likely to engage with future emails.
<h2 id=""safesenderlists""><b>Safe Sender Lists</b></h2>
<b> </b>Make sure to have your members put your chamber/association on their safe sender list to help ensure your emails get through and do not end up sitting in a spam folder.
<h2 id=""educationalemailseries""><b>Educational Email Series</b><b></b></h2>
Consider making an educational email series designed to teach your members about what your chamber or association does and it's past, present and future goals and achievements. Prepare a campaign consisting of a handful of emails sent over the course of a few weeks to introduce new members to you and bring them up to speed.
<h2 id=""restatethebenefits""><b>Restate the Benefits </b></h2>
The benefits of joining your chamber or association should be apparent, and it'd be duly required to continue reminding newcomers of the member benefits in the welcome email can help eliminate the chances of buyer’s remorse by justifying their decision.
<h2 id=""officialwelcome""><b>Official Welcome</b></h2>
If you have an email newsletter, include a public greeting to your new members. Listing them under a section titled ‘Welcome new members!’ can act as a nice introduction for the new members to the existing members, whilst making the new members feel appreciated.
<h2 id=""maintenance"">Maintaining Your Chamber Email Marketing Success</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-5305"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/agreement-2548138_1920.jpg"" alt=""maintaining subscribers"" width=""1619"" height=""1080"" />

The advice for this category is more general, applicable to most if not all stages of an email marketing strategy. By keeping members engaged with your email marketing, your chamber is less likely to have to resort to re-engaging inactive subscribers. By and large, the bulk of our advice comes under the Maintenance section. These tips will be handy for all parts of your email engagement strategy, so keep them in mind during onboarding and re-energizing as well.
<h2 id=""personalizationagain""><b>Personalization (Again)</b></h2>
<b> </b>Consistency is key, and that’s no less true for this blog. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, our first tip for maintaining member engagement with emails is personalization. But think more than just the sender name. <a href=""https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2016/01/70-email-marketing-stats-you-need-to-know/"">Studies have shown</a> that having a personalized or catchy subject line can increase your email’s open rate by 26%. Also, use this opportunity to take advantage of your entire membership CRM.

You can mention details specific to each member, such as their membership level, upcoming birthday, upcoming membership renewal deadline, events attended, local events and more. Members will feel as if their time as part of your chamber or association is valued.
<h2 id=""employautomation""><b>Employ Automation </b></h2>
Have time or action triggered emails sent at suitable moments to take the legwork out of doing it yourself. That personalized birthday greeting could be an automated email. If a member or prospective member open a certain article or blog post on your site, send an automated email with similar content (e.g. ‘We saw you were interested in ..... Would you like to find out more?’)
<h2 id=""employsegmentation""><b>Employ Segmentation</b></h2>
In layman’s terms, grouping your subscribers and putting them in an individual mailing list. Define the segments you plan to create and then create custom email campaigns for each one. These groups could range from spectator subscribers - those who have never purchased a product/attended an event but visit your website and consume your content so should be easy to convert - to subscribers who have purchased membership from you in the past but have not engaged with your site or your content ever since - to subscribers whose engagement is consistently high.
<h2 id=""bemobilefriendly""><b>Be Mobile-friendly</b></h2>
<b> </b>A must in this day and age. Your emails are likely to be shunned entirely if they do not translate into a mobile-friendly format. <a href=""https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2018/12/70-email-marketing-stats-you-need-to-know/"">About 53% of emails are opened on mobile devices. 79% of smartphone owners use their device for email and data for over 1.8 billion opens from campaigns sent in 2013</a> shows that mobile is the most popular environment for a subscriber’s first interaction with an email. In most likelihoods then, your members are going to first open your email on their handheld device.

They will thank you for having a format that doesn’t need to be enlarged or has content cut off. Investing in mobile optimization is guaranteed to pay off for your chamber.
<h2 id=""stayalert""><b>Stay Alert </b></h2>
Changes made by your email platform and general advancements in technology may impact your email marketing. In tandem with the new dawn of Artificial Intelligence, Gmail and Outlook have now made their platforms compatible with Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant.

With smart speaker users at a high (<a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/content/global-smart-speaker-users-2019"">85.5million or 10% of all internet users in China, 74.2 million or 26% of internet users in the US, and 12.6 million or 22.4% of internet users in the UK have a smart speaker</a>), making your emails more voice compatible will help keep up with these technological changes. Alexa will read the sender's name, subject line, and text.

She reads emojis but will ignore images and certain HTML attributes, so choose emojis with care or simply avoid them altogether. If you do use emojis, try ones whose names will catch the attention of listeners when reading out loud and out of context, especially in the subject line or the preview text.

Alexa will ignore your images (and the alt text you used to describe them) so avoid putting key information inside images. Instead, use images to support your message but put important information in the text body. Use proper semantic elements appropriately in your email, especially for text, such as headings (h) and paragraphs (p).
<h2 id=""timingiscrucial""><b>Timing is Crucial </b></h2>
One of the major players in email marketing fatigue is volume. If you overload on the emails, no matter how engaging or relevant the content may be, open and response rates will decline. There are a number of appropriate times for sending emails: during a membership drive, during the membership renewal period, approaching an event, conference, or important capital campaign, when your chamber or association is being recognized with an award, around members’ birthday or holidays.

In fact, your members will expect emails around these times so they will already be inclined to interact with them.
<h2 id=""avoidnoreply""><b>Avoid No Reply</b></h2>
<b> </b>Make sure members can respond to your emails. “No reply” emails set an unfavorable precedent that your organization is difficult to get in touch with which is the opposite impression you want to make
<h2 id=""beeyecatching""><b>Be Eye-catching</b></h2>
Have an on-brand and not overly complicated email design to reel members in. Visually appealing emails are more likely to encourage engagement than text-heavy emails. However, don’t overload the email with images, videos and design features that can distract recipients from the message of the email and also risk slowing the load times. You don’t want to risk recipients giving up rather than waiting for the email to load
<h2 id=""conversationaltone""><b>Conversational Tone</b></h2>
<b> </b>Keep it light with a friendly tone that is likely to fulfill the requisites of our keyword: personalization. This might not be useful in all your forms of communication, but for emails, it has been proven that a conversational tone provides a sense of genuine interaction between members and chambers. This sense of personal touch will have engagement at a high as members are comfortable and at ease with communicating with your chamber.
<h2 id=""stayrelevant""><b>Stay Relevant, Informative, and Interesting</b></h2>
Occasionally provide news articles about topics that your members are interested in. Tailor the information to suit their interests - you should already know the kind of content they want to see as they are a member of your chamber! This will instill confidence in the members that your chamber is on top of the latest current affairs and happenings within their fields of interest, and consequently, they’ll be more likely to take other messages seriously.
<h2 id=""integratesocialmedia""><b>Integrate Social Media </b></h2>
<b> </b>Link your profiles in your email’s header and footer and include a “follow” button in your email’s header, footer, or body. You could even embed a particular post in your email’s body, promote a hashtag for your members to use, or ask members to share content on their own social media pages. Make your social media strategy as simple as possible so members can follow it with ease - they won’t want to go out of their way to engage!
<h2 id=""sendactivityemails""><b>Send Activity Emails</b></h2>
These are emails that contain updates, notifications, and summaries of user activities. Activity emails tend to be the ones that members are actually happiest to receive, meaning they are perfect for increasing member engagement.
<h2 id=""crosssellsandupsells""><b>Cross-Sells &amp; Up-Sells</b></h2>
<b> </b>Use emails to offer the opportunity to purchase merchandise or a membership package that is similar or an upgrade to what your members already have.
<h2 id=""surveyemails""><b>Survey emails </b></h2>
These can be extremely useful for getting members to come back, and for getting new members as well, as they help you to improve the membership experience in any way possible. You can send surveys to members who chose to join, or leads who didn’t join, your association or chambers. You can even send surveys to your general audience to segment them based on their particular needs so that you can create and tailor your membership specifically <a href=""https://optinmonster.com/50-smart-ways-to-segment-your-email-list/"">to each of your segments</a>. <a href=""https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2016/01/online-survey-best-practices-drive-results/""> Surveys</a> are also a great way of showing your members that you care about what they think whilst proving to your members that you want to improve for them.

Making the effort to allow your members to see that you care about them is more likely to result in them reciprocating these efforts. Provide an incentive for survey responses too in the form of discount codes, coupons or prizes and send them at optimal times of the day, before and after work, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays, when <a href=""https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2019/06/online-survey-best-practices-drive-results/"">studies have proven</a> are the best times to send them.
<h2 id=""targetedquestions""><b>Targeted Questions</b></h2>
Instead of bombarding members with a lengthy survey for them to complete, you could also just ask one targeted question in an email. This will result in a much larger response rate as members don’t feel bogged down with a task that includes several questions.
<h2 id=""thingstoavoid""><b>Things to Avoid:</b></h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Avoid certain words: Free, This is Not Spam, Great Offer, etc. can all (ironically and counterproductively) put you at risk to be sent straight to the spam folder</li>
 	<li>Images: No text and a single image in your email (such as an event flyer) is a no-go. A reasonable ratio to have is 60% text, 40% image.</li>
 	<li>Avoid Attachments where possible: At best, they can slow load times and at worst, carry a virus.</li>
 	<li>Avoid All capital letters: NOTHING SCREAMS FRAUD LIKE ALL CAPS. Additionally, it can be quite an assault on the eyes.</li>
 	<li>Punctuation: go easy on the punctuation. Use it properly and keep in mind that Spam and phishing emails often include more than one exclamation point!!!!!</li>
 	<li>Avoid Certain Fonts: Keep it simple. Unusual fonts and colored fonts can impact how email renders.</li>
 	<li>Misspelling: Sometimes a result of phishing by non-English speaking hackers, misspellings in an email can increase the likelihood of it being deemed risky.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=""re-energize"">Re-energizing Members with Chamber Email Marketing</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-5481"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/membership-key-features@2x.png"" alt=""re-energizing members"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

The worst has happened. Your subscribers are inactive and their engagement with your chamber’s promotional material is frozen. The good news is you have nothing to lose as you initiate your re-engagement strategy. Thaw their interests with an effective strategy to get your chamber’s email marketing back on top.
<h2 id=""ensureyouremailsaregettingthrough""><b>Ensure Your Emails Are Getting Through</b></h2>
<b> </b>People’s contact details may have changed; your email might be residing in the dark corners of the junk box or spam folder, or the email delivery simply may have failed. A lot can go wrong technically so first and foremost, check that the back end of your email management is on form. Knowing the difference between a “soft bounce” (something is wrong on your member’s end - mailbox full, server down, etc.) and a hard bounce (the email address doesn’t exist or isn’t valid) is helpful.
<h2 id=""resend""><b>Resend</b></h2>
<b> </b>Keep in mind that your subscriber’s email box is probably overcrowded, so they might have missed your first re-engagement email. Send it again just in case!
<h2 id=""useinactivityemails""><b>Use Inactivity Emails</b></h2>
<b></b>Use emails to re-engage customers who haven’t interacted with your chamber or association in a while. Sometimes, members may disengage from your chamber and community because they do not understand fully what it does for them or it no longer feels relevant. Send an email with actionable and serviceable advice that can encourage them to become greater participants and more active within your chamber. As mentioned before, if they are already totally inactive then there is nothing to lose.
<h2 id=""remembersegmentation""><b>Remember Segmentation</b></h2>
<b> </b>Those who haven’t engaged with your emails in the past six months or so should be put into their own inactive subscriber group so that they can be targeted for re-engagement or inactivity emails.
<h2 id=""rememberautomation""><b>Remember Automation</b></h2>
When an inactive subscriber clicks on an offer highlighted in your re-engagement email, an action trigger could send a follow-up email thanking them for reconnecting automatically.
<h2 id=""combinesegmentationandautomation""><b>Combine Segmentation and Automation</b></h2>
Using both the aforementioned features chambers and associations can add members to different subscriber groups based on their actions. Automation allows you to do this with ease. For example, if you send a re-engagement email asking people to choose their preferred frequency of emails, they will be automatically moved to a subscriber group based on their choice.

Target your emails using these sub-lists instead of just sending out to the entire list. Just as in the onboarding emails you allowed them to choose the frequency and types of emails they received, allow them to update their preferences frequently so they are only receiving the information that is most relevant to them and thus most likely to stay subscribers.
<h2 id=""incentiveemails""><b>Incentive Emails</b></h2>
<b> </b>Offer tantalizing treats or VIP offers in your emails! You could offer a variety of creative ideas: Early registration to popular events, early-bird prices, invitations to exclusive events, exclusive access to webinars, podcasts, courses, customized recommendations, discounts and coupons, and free, limited-run branded gifts. These options and any of your own ideas could reignite a spark of excitement in your chamber that was flickering. You could combine this with expanding your member population by offering current members who refer people to you an exclusive gift. The existing members are more likely to stick around because of the favor, whilst your chamber will benefit from an expanding membership.
<h2 id=""haveaseriesofreengagementevents""><b>Have a Series of Re-engagement Events</b></h2>
<b> </b>On your mission to re-energize members, let them know that your goal is to nurture an active community. Re-engagement events can be hosted online if need be; Webinars, Live streaming Q&amp;As and interviews, coaching session workshops and classes, and theme days are all options you could try. Try using EventBank’s management software to create an official event page for your event that attracts members and has them ready to reintegrate with the community.
<h2 id=""renewalreminders""><b>Renewal Reminders</b></h2>
It is essential to remind members to renew their membership shortly before it expires. You can send a call to action to have members turn on an automatic renewal, so neither you nor they have to think about it again! If you offer a free trial similarly don’t forget to remind your users to continue their membership.
<h2 id=""givemembersachoice""><b>Give Members a Choice</b></h2>
Finally, allow the option to leave. People change and a subscriber might've lost all interest in your emails. Presenting the choice of leaving forces them to confront whether or not they would like to keep receiving your emails and could be a push in the right direction. If not, you are keeping your lists clean by getting rid of inactive subscribers.

If you are attentive to your subscribers' actions and desires, then you should be able to run your email marketing campaigns successfully, fostering a high open-rate and enhanced engagement with your chamber or association. Stay on top of your strategy by following this guide and maximize your email engagement!

<h5><strong><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit"">通过创新型CRM深度了解及管理受众群体</span></span></span></span></strong></h5>
<span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit"">高效营销的前提是精准的受众定位，商协会的受众与其他类型营销受众不同，因为商协会面对的受众分为多种类型：企业，个人，组织等传统模式中，商协会的会员信息存储在电子表格或会员管理软件内，这样的数据一旦超过一定数量（100位以上），或者超过一段时间（一年以上），数据的分析和管理就变成了难题。对商协会而言，扁平的数字对掌握受众特点和与组织的关系，提升会员服务和影响力没有帮助。</span></span></span></span>

<span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit"">CRM（客户关系管理）平台是数字化时代新的会员数据管理方式。在众多平台中，EventBank的会员与会员互动一体化管理的SaaS的平台是更完善和引领的平台，专为商协会等会员型组织管理流程设计其中的核心 - 创新型CRM模块，则更具领先性，能最大化地留存和扩大会员数据价值。</span></span></span></span>

<span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit"">全球顶尖商协会选择的EventBank云平台，首次打通了商协会与会员互动的所有环节，囊括入会前互动，注册入会，会费缴纳，参与活动，接收和订阅营销邮件/电子出版物等一方面创新。型CRM能使以上所有流程中的数据全部自动流入和汇总;另一方面，根据实时更新不断积累的信息，能够随时掌握和分析会员的行为特征，为商协会的数字化营销提供指导和依据。</span></span></span></span>

<span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit"">如：通过CRM内存储的签约数据，能够设置自定义时间的缴费提醒，自动按照设置（并且能够叠加）的时间发送提醒邮件，并能在邮件中设置“提前续费”的优惠和折扣，从而大大提升会员的续费率。</span></span></span></span>

<span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit"">（EventBank云平台的自动化续费提醒功能，可以设置多个指定时间发送给每一位会员，在缴费提醒邮件中可以直接进行续费，财务信息追踪也变得十分容易。任何形式的界面，移动端也好，PC端也罢，均可完成支付，也帮助了财务团队更加高效地完成工作。）</span></span></span></span>

<span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit"">苏州欧洲商会（DUSA欧洲协会苏州）连续三年采用EventBank的会员云平台，通过综合运用平台中的模块，</span></span></span></span><strong><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit"">保持年均85％及以上的续费率</span></span></span></span></strong><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit"">。在EventBank的会员管理模块控制面板，可以清晰的看到近7天/ 30天/ 90天/ 365天等时间的续约人数，续约率等情况，能够查看具体的续约人和未续约人从而有针对性地跟进提醒或响应会员</span></span></span><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit"">其他需求来进一步促进续约。</span></span></span></span>

 	<li><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit"">活动营销</span></span></li>

<h5><strong><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit"">突破性汇总留存全部活动数据</span></span></strong></h5>
<h5><strong><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit"">每一次活动经费都不白费</span></span></strong></h5>
<span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit"">举办各种活动也是商协会整合资源，为会员提供价值服务，扩大影响力的重要手段。而运用数字化营销赋能传统活动，则是帮助商协会高效快捷地创建活动，完整安全地留存活动数据，并通过精准的分析实现更多新会员和商业机会的转化。</span></span>

<span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit"">英国商会（新加坡）每年举办近百场活动。现全部采用EventBank的活动管理云模块，实现网站和APP生成及一体化的数据和支付管理。</span></span>

<img class=""rich_pages aligncenter"" src=""https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_jpg/2rvgNuSwQbKzygsNlcZg4xAVl1Nm10goJ5X6TCxAHRXracYXoGe11KTkWMCVDswhjm5ibpIpTgoHiarTIkdjg64Q/640?wx_fmt=jpeg"" data-copyright=""0"" data-ratio=""1.0361305361305362"" data-s=""300,640"" data-type=""jpeg"" data-w=""858"" />
<p style=""text-align: center""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit"">（图为英国商会（新加坡）通过EventBank云平台活动管理模块快速创建的最新活动页面 - 部分）</span></span></p>
<span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit"">活动前期每个普通员工都可以通过EventBank云平台的活动管理模块，完成整个活动所有流程的创建和管理。同时通过打通所有环节的创新型CRM来对联系人（会员或潜在会员）进行自定义分组，可以向不同分组发送个性化的邀请邮件，并能够实时地将邮件打开，活动注册等情况汇总到CRM中，随时掌控活动邀请情况。</span></span>

<span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit"">对很多专职人员不多的商协会来说，举办活动时可能会聘请临时工作人员，但培训成本和会员信息保密性也引起很多商协会的顾虑.EventBank的活动管理模块支持添加“临时管理员” ，可以在保证参会者信息不泄露且不遗漏的同时，让志愿者获得临时的签到管理权限，使人员不足不再是制约商协会开展活动的短板。</span></span>

<img class=""rich_pages aligncenter"" src=""https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_gif/2rvgNuSwQbKzygsNlcZg4xAVl1Nm10goUdFsn2ibXM5XdJ6gMDiaot7aZLGt701IKW43nlWsLbBViccT1Uot3DVJA/640?wx_fmt=gif"" data-copyright=""0"" data-ratio=""0.3103448275862069"" data-type=""gif"" data-w=""638"" />

<span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit"">（在活动开始之前可以通过邮件邀请成为临时工作人员，活动结束后权限自动失效。临时工作人员账户的设置旨在帮助协助商协会的团队进行现场注册和签到。无权访问客户EventBank云平台上任何其他模块。全面保证活动流程顺畅及客户数据的安全。）</span></span>

<span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit"">如果没有一体化的平台，商协会每年举办的多场活动不仅活动页面难以留存，活动数据也割裂，很容易因为人为的疏忽或不同平台之间的不兼容而导致数据遗漏，举办活动的效果也就大打折扣。</span></span>

EventBank的活动与会员云平台贯穿商协会活动管理与会员管理的全部流程，使得每一次举办活动后的数字资产及数据资产都能够自动且完整地留存。不止如此，CRM还会自动过滤重复的联系人信息，并将同一个联系人的所有与商协会互动产生的全部数据汇总到一起——如报名了哪些活动、到场了哪些活动、在活动中去过哪些分会场等，<strong>详实清晰的数据能够帮助商协会实时立体地分析联系人画像，助力有针对性、个性化的再营销。</strong>
<h4><strong><b>商协会的电子邮件营销</b></strong></h4>
电子邮件是一种非常有效的营销资源，尤其对商协会而言。因为商协会的目标受众、入会的会员和企业都将电子邮件作为工作场景的沟通方式，会额外重视电子邮件传递的内容。并且电子邮件能够体现个性化内容，更是不可多得的展示平台。如果你的组织只是运用电子邮件偶尔发送一些续缴会费提醒或不定期的内容，而不知道发些什么，以下是几个有效的方法：
<ul>
 	<li>发送每周简报，其中包含商协会的最新内容、活动信息、行业数据和工作机会等内容。</li>
 	<li>将新订阅者设为智能列表，向他们发送感谢内容，并附上商协会的简介等教育性内容。</li>
 	<li>将有付费意愿的会员设为智能列表，感谢他们的贡献，并定期向其发送其他的付费机会。</li>
 	<li>同时不要忘了将邮件订阅的方式添加在商协会网站的主页上，以获取更多的订阅机会。</li>
</ul>
以上几种方法着重提到了“智能列表”，是基于帮助定位受众的CRM而言的。将CRM与邮件营销打通才能发挥其最大价值。

中国德国商会全面使用EventBank的会员及会员互动一体化SaaS管理平台，在电子邮件营销方面，德商会使用EventBank会员云中的电子邮件营销模块去创建和管理其全年的200多封不同主题不同分组的营销邮件。

<img class=""size-full wp-image-11182 aligncenter"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/WeChat-Screenshot_20190723232854.png"" alt="""" />

EventBank会员云平台中的邮件营销模块，打通创新型CRM中的数据，能够根据不同的标签和情况设置自定义智能列表，方便对不同受众实现个性化的邮件营销。

同时德商会通过EventBank会员云平台的邮件营销模块，能够从邮件性能分析面板一目了然地实时查看邮件营销效果，分析细化到每个人的打开、点击、阅读等行为数据。因为这些数据都会实时流入CRM中，不断更新的数据助力营销邮件的效果提升。
<h4>商协会视频营销</h4>
无论他们是在消费工作，学校还是娱乐内容，人们都更喜欢视频内容。作为一个商协会，视频营销是获取所有受众的兴趣和支持的绝佳方式。

以下是视频可以帮助您推广您的商协会的几个原因：
<ol>
 	<li>视频是视觉的。我们处理视觉内容的速度比书面内容快60,000倍。同时视频还能让人记住更多内容。</li>
 	<li>视频是个人的。它激发了同理心和情感，这是其他类型的营销所不能说的。</li>
 	<li>视频是教育性的。许多组织需要教育他们的社区他们的原因，以获得关注和资金。视频可以帮助您做到这一点。</li>
 	<li>视频可分享。每分钟都有超过700个YouTube视频在Twitter上分享。消费者喜欢分享视频，特别是那些激发和共鸣的视频。</li>
 	<li>视频很有趣。观看者在有视频的页面上花费100％的时间。让您的访问者，关注者和支持者参与并对视频感兴趣。</li>
</ol>
<h3></h3>
女孩效应是一个致力于赋予全球女孩权力的非营利组织，是视频营销的一个很好的例子。该组织的主页是一个视频，可以立即吸引访客的注意力。此外，当您点击“查看更多”时，该网站会打开一个信息性视频，告诉您关于女孩效应的所有信息。

<h4>非营利性社交媒体营销</h4>
社交媒体是商协会中非常受欢迎的营销策略。它不仅免费，而且为组织提供展示其品牌个性并与其粉丝和支持者互动的途径。

以下是一些使用社交媒体进行非营利性营销的方式：
<ul>
 	<li>分享有关您的组织和原因的新闻</li>
 	<li>提升品牌知名度和认知度</li>
 	<li>招募志愿者和员工</li>
 	<li><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit"">宣传会员，员工和志愿者</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit"">另外，让策略工具为您服务。使用Google Alerts和社交监控工具提醒您何时提及您的组织，主题标签或相关主题或关键字。这为获取UGC提供了机会，获得了新主题创意的灵感，并参与了相关的对话。</span></span></span></span>
<h4><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit"">商协会网站营销</span></span></span></span></h4>
<span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit"">每个商协会都应该有一个网站。网站可作为您组织的数字家庭基地，包括重要信息 - 您的立场以及访客如何参与和帮助。</span></span></span></span>

<span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit""><span style=""vertical-align: inherit"">您的网站还包含重要资产，如您的博客，社交媒体流，活动信息，视频等......基本上是您的其他营销策略。最后，您的网站可以激励和吸引受众群体。</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>

When passionate, enthusiastic people come together on a regular and punctual basis, good things can take off in the local community!

<h2 id=""value"">Create Value</h2>
In the world of work, networking contacts are easily forgotten. But once in a while, we connect with someone who makes a significant impact on us. Being that person for someone else gives members the chance to contribute to the wider business community in a variety of ways.

Each member brings their own experiences, skill sets and networks along with them, so why not maximize them and create even more? Value is what makes members feel connected to each other and to your Chamber, so putting it at the forefront of your chamber success strategies is sure to create lasting worthwhile relationships.
<h2 id=""education"">Opportunities for Education</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-78"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Build-Measure-Learn-300x188.jpg"" alt=""success strategy for chambers"" width=""300"" height=""188"" />

Growth never stops and as professionals, upskilling is a way to ensure that you can get the most out of your industry. Chambers can play a role in providing opportunities for education through events and dialogue. From digital transformation to mentoring, providing opportunities for members to improve themselves not only makes your Chamber worth their contribution but enriches your quality relationship with them.

Equally, it will set your Chamber apart from most others and create a reputation of self-development and opportunity. Providing education can equally take place through a diversity of means. Blogs, Q&amp;As, and surveys allow you to find your member’s specific preferences and cater to them. Being attentive lets you know your members inside out.

Education is one of the most organic chamber success strategies because it creates a two-way relationship in which both sides can benefit and collaborate.
<h2 id=""community"">Create a Community</h2>
A sense of community is what separates your Chamber from a business that just talks at disaffected customers. Communities are made up of like-minded individuals who are working towards a greater goal for their joint benefit. You can create community through engaging with the immediate location of your Chamber. Education, parks, local spaces, and healthcare are all part of the bigger picture.

Meeting the needs of your local community is how you demonstrate care and passion for the symbiotic relationship between community and business. Being a prominent part of the community builds a trust that could attract others to want to be a part of your Chamber and make it a success.

The community can even be extended to the online world. Professional social media platforms such as LinkedIn can become equally as key to keeping everyone in the loop. Successful chamber strategies often start outside the Chamber with the community surrounding it and focus on how these groups can be brought closer to the Chamber itself.
<h2 id=""longterm"">Think Long Term</h2>
Short term results are an easy prize. Interest, however, is short-lived. Focusing on enabling long term relationships will benefit your chamber more. Not only are these in themselves a powerful resource, but they can also supply repeated results that will grow consistently over time with your Chamber.

Thinking long term means doing away with personal self-gain and instead investing in a meaningful future for your Chamber - it may not produce instant results, but it is truly rewarding in the long term.
<h2 id=""marketing"">Marketing and Branding</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-649"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/email-marketing.png"" alt=""successful marketing for chambers"" width=""225"" height=""225"" />

Giving your Chamber its own identity makes it unique and easy to differentiate from others. Branding is a way of creating a story around yourselves and marketing is a way of communicating this to potential members. Digitally, it is the best way of engaging with the upcoming, millennial audience of young professionals and diversifying your membership.

Catering your marketing materials to the specific demographic your chamber aims to represent equally makes your marketing more precise. Whether it is young professionals, entrepreneurs, family businesses or agriculture, each must feel like the materials they interact with were made specifically for them.
<h2 id=""leadership"">Leadership</h2>
A successful chamber has leadership at its helm. The role of a committee is to steer a chamber’s general direction, but executive leadership is what provides the driving initiative for them to follow.

Good leadership listens and directs while ensuring that the Chamber fulfills its purpose - both members and committees should be involved in decision making and the results recorded and assessed so their successes and failures can be recorded.

Leaders can become a part of important conversations that move commerce forward through joining committees, legislative affairs meetings and interactions with local government policy. If your chamber can position itself as a leader of opinion, more people are likely to engage with it as a body they respect.
<h2 id=""data"">Data</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-2939"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Chamber-Nation-380x207.png"" alt=""data cms for chambers"" width=""374"" height=""204"" /></p>
Data is the number <b>one </b>tool for understanding, processing and planning goals for your Chamber. Using an online contact management system (CMS) to track your members' attendance, preferences and availability is just the beginning. Your chamber should be able to understand what they are experiencing within the business world, what their challenges are, and where they see themselves heading in the future.

All-in-one software is convenient because it takes the pressure off Chamber staff and it creates success stories too. The Italian Chamber of Commerce’s <a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/success-story-italian-chamber-hong-kong/"">30%</a> growth with EventBank shows that when data is used and combined with an all-round strategy, solid growth can be achieved. This part of the modernization that all Chambers need to undergo to put their best foot forward in a digitalized world.
<h2 id=""leadership"">Philosophy</h2>
An operating philosophy is made up of the core principles of your Chamber. What guiding principle unites your membership, executive and committee? How can they be projected in a way that attracts people? What place do these principles have in your Chamber’s future and what do you hope to achieve with them?

An operating philosophy is much more than just words on display. It should be representative of your Chamber and the ways it operates, true authenticism is the one consistent attraction for new members and acts as a reminder of those within your chamber of what they are striving for. This is one of the chamber success strategies you just can't fake!
<h2 id=""retention"">Retention</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-867 size-medium"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/boss-reviewing-stuff-s-364x204.png"" alt=""successful chamber membership retention"" width=""364"" height=""204"" /></p>
More important than attracting new members, retention is what gives your successful Chamber strategy sustainable longevity. Whether it is over 9 months or 5 years, member retention maintains steady growth. The 2017 Association of Chamber of Commerce Executives Trends in Chamber Operations <a href=""https://institute.uschamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ACCE_FY2017-ChamberOperationsSurvey_USCHAMBER-final.pdf"">report </a>shows that average member retention levels stay between 85% and 87%. When first-year membership is examined specifically, this figure drops even further down to a concerning 63%.

Making sure members stick around is all about giving them something to look forward to that is worth the fee. There is a positive correlation between membership and value - the more value provided, the more chance of your retention rate reflecting a satisfied and happy membership.

Member retention is boosted by a combination of meaningful engagement, feedback, and interaction. Organic, non-forced engagement with a chamber is what makes members join and <b>stay</b> for the foreseeable future.
<h2 id=""participation"">Participation</h2>
Participation is one of the key ways of interacting with your membership; not only at events but through surveys and emails to collect feedback and allow them to shape the chamber they are a part of. Active contact makes members feel that their voice is valued and appreciated, and brings them even further into the fold. This successful chamber strategy is sure to help staff relate to members as unique individuals with their own separate interests and occupations to build a rapport with them too.

The digital economy has changed the way chambers communicate with their membership and vice versa. Because more people are spending more of their time online, communication must be done both online and in-person to make sure that no one gets left behind. Being adaptable enough to operate on both fronts is essential for capturing the majority of your membership, irrespective of their age.
<h2 id=""leadership"">Community Leadership</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-590"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Confernece-380x112.jpg"" alt=""successful chamber community"" width=""380"" height=""112"" />

Community leadership creates an enthusiastic, engaged membership. Get involved with community leaders at ground level - their visibility can transfer to the Chamber and this can create a local buzz. Celebrating those who are leaders in their own way is a great idea - i.e. awarding “Student Entrepreneur of the Year” and similar awards in partnership with local education institutions can drive interest and publicity. Successful chamber strategies are all about appealing to those who are already existing members and those with <strong>just</strong> as much potential to join in the future.

Building a successful chamber starts with understanding what you are offering, what you plan to do and what this can do for your membership. In the long term, these measures can become the key to repeated, consistent growth. Any dynamic organization can reinvent and adapt itself, no matter the landscape.

<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-10300"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CMOBF-KOL-01-raw17_1-1.jpg"" alt=""Group socialising at marketing event"" width=""1620"" height=""1080"" />

Events marketing or experiential marketing is a way companies can directly engage with customers. In addition, it is a way to promote a brand, product or service. It gives the chance to be fun, creative and therefore leaves a mark in the customer's mind. This means hosting an event gives a unique way to engage with an audience which marketing media like print or TV advertisements just cannot do.

Examples of event marketing for brands could include an experiential pop-up, hosting a conference, holding webinars or sponsoring a popular event. The type of event which you choose to host should depend both on your company and your goals. Different companies will have different audiences who will each need to be uniquely addressed.

Brands are able to use events marketing in two key ways, these are online and offline.
<h3>Online</h3>

<h3>Trade Shows</h3>
This is where many brands in the same industry gather. You are able to hire a space and showcase your brand here. As trade shows are usually within once industry this means the attendees will already be interested in the category you are competing in.
<h3>Conferences</h3>
These are a perfect way to deliver a lot of information about your service. Conferences have a large education focus.

Your team should get together and hold a brainstorming session to come up with the best ideas.

This one is often overlooked in events marketing but it is a great way to get the maximum ROI from attendees. So make sure to gather information about your attendee's demographics. Use this to create quality data lists so you are able to re-target the attendees in the future with precision.
<h3>Partners</h3>
Make sure you choose these very carefully. Pick agencies, influences and collaborators which have the same passion for your audience as you. It is Granted that if your partners do not have passion behind them this will always be clear at the event and attendees will not have a great brand impression.
<h3>Include social media</h3>
This is an easy method to generate buzz around your event. Use the platform to get the word out about what your brand is doing and generate awareness so people attend. You can also use social at the event. Create hashtags or competitions to bring in user-generated content and continue to bring your brand messaging to the public.

12261,"26 Ways to Provide Value for Your Chamber Members","Success! Your chamber has managed to attract new members. But what next? Holding on to your members is as crucial a task as acquiring them, and can be daunting. Making sure you provide value with your membership package is an obvious necessity, but in times of change and accelerated digital growth how can you stay on top of the trends?

We all know that membership is critical for the success and future sustainability of chambers and associations. Paying members will expect tangible benefits from your chamber that reflect the value of their annual membership subscription, so providing this value and improving it as member needs and challenges evolve is a fundamental tenet of chamber functions.

A research publication from <a href=""https://www.asaecenter.org/publications/102404-the-decision-to-join-how-individuals-determine-value-and-why-they-choose-to-belong"">ASAE Press</a> assessed the importance of different individual field-wide benefits of memberships to people who were thinking of joining.
<table style=""border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;"">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style=""width: 50%;""><strong>The highest-rated individual benefits were:</strong>
• Networking
• Access to current information on one’s field
• Professional development</td>
<td style=""width: 50%;""><strong>The highest-rated field benefits were:</strong>
• Promotion of the field
• Creation of standards &amp; codes of ethics
• Advocacy</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
The study shows that these benefits are the lifeblood of any chamber success, attracting and retaining new members, and the areas where you should be injecting value the most. But in today's rapidly changing society where new generations of members have higher expectations than before, how are chambers to provide meaningful value that keeps members engaged? The following tips should guide you through providing and improving membership value.

<h2 id=""embrace"">Embrace Digital Transformation</h2>
Assessing and implementing digital methods to support and improve membership processes is the best way to stay relevant and valuable to your members. In an environment where advances in technology mean that business owners and stakeholders can find digital tools that could potentially replace the benefits of a chamber membership, digital transformation is essential. Dues-paying members will expect chambers to have a well-established website and social media, updated mobile apps, and digital tools to create an impressive web presence.

As Richard Gott, the <a href=""https://www.getsetforgrowth.com/blog/improving-member-engagement/"">Founder of The MemberWise Network</a>, puts it: “The membership and association sector is waking up to the fact that future long-term member value and growth requires a deeper focus on online membership experience and engagement”
<h2 id=""prioritize"">Prioritize communication</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-10167 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-39.png"" alt="""" width=""694"" height=""460"" />

Use blogs, forums, wiki and collaboration pages, and micro-blogging features to ensure information is readily available for your members. Members can interact with your Chamber and update their preferences easily with quizzes and surveys. A two-way communication pool will increase the membership value significantly as members feel listened to and catered for. Be attentive and prove that you know what your members want by implementing their suggestions and recognizing their needs. Don’t be afraid of constructive criticism!
<h2 id=""listen"">Listen</h2>
Listening is a critical part of a two-way communication system. Members will often ask for what they need or want and implementing their desires will be a surefire way of proving your worth to them.
<h2 id=""stay"">Stay human</h2>
A faceless automaton running a chamber is not a good look, and members will lose interest in their membership if they feel as though the chamber is inhuman and impersonal. Members would rather hear from their Chamber’s too much rather than not at all. Provide information on a daily basis, whether it be through social media, email marketing, blogs, newsletters, or RSS feeds, and make sure you maintain a human presence and likable attitude. The more they hear from you, the more they’ll be able to say about what it is you do for them - don’t keep all your correspondence virtual!
<h2 id=""outline"">Outline Your Goals</h2>
Broadcasting your goals and agenda will delineate your chamber’s focus and help members pinpoint exactly what it is your chamber does and what is useful to them.
<h2 id=""be"">Be Fast</h2>
Do not make members wait - members will expect responses to their concerns and queries fast. The first way to increase value is simply to increase the speed you deliver the kind of value members are paying for. The faster, the better. You will perceive a direct correlation between speed and efficacy and value.
<h2 id=""get"">Get to Know Your Members</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-9904 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-20.png"" alt="""" width=""574"" height=""276"" />

Know your audience inside and out. Value can be subjective so it is imperative to hone in on your audience and understand what their marketing objectives are. Sometimes your events, marketing, and messages communicating value may be different depending on the kind of member you are trying to reach. Use surveys to keep on top of member concerns, desires, and ideas. Members will value a chamber more that actively wants to know them.
<h2 id=""implement"">Implement Tiered Dues</h2>
Some chambers will have a one-size-fits-all membership and that could work for them. But do your members have varied priorities? If so, implementing tiered dues will increase the value of your chamber membership. You could complete a member needs assessment to determine what is important to their success and what benefits are truly valuable to them. Build your membership levels accordingly. You will be able to see paradigms that will help you determine what benefits are most valuable to members at different stages of growth. Assess the level of value you will provide for each tier and correspond value to cost.

If you choose this approach, your association needs to use targeted marketing that appeals directly to specific membership categories.
<h2 id=""segment"">Segment Memberships</h2>
Segmenting your memberships allows you to send only targeted, relevant information to members with and across the different tiers already implemented. You could, for example, segment into small and large businesses, or allow members to choose the level of their subscription so that they only receive the information they really want.
<h2 id=""inject"">Inject Variety into Your Events</h2>
Host events for different segmented members. Regularly orchestrate events that are helpful for members with larger organizations and host separate events for smaller, growing businesses in the area, ensuring each and every one of your members is gaining value that is specific and relevant to their needs and interests,
<h2 id=""make"">Make Events Accessible From Afar</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-12843 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/World-Map-Capture.jpg"" alt=""eventbank locations on world map"" width=""1183"" height=""613"" />

&nbsp;

It may be that members nowadays do not have the availability to attend every event you host. Allow online networking opportunities to compensate for this by providing an online forum where they can virtually connect in their own time! Furthermore, provide opportunities for members to keep up with events online through live updates or streaming, recorded/photographed event highlights and shared resources so members can feel engaged even when they are not there.
<h2 id=""tailor"">Tailor Your Events</h2>
Host events and activities that are appropriate and in keeping with the times. An event that is targeted specifically at your audience’s needs will be a lot more valuable than a generic event such as a golf tournament. If you know some of your member’s businesses
<h2 id=""innovate"">Innovate</h2>
Inject new life and spirit into the membership community by trying something new and unusual, whether this be throwing a different kind of event, hosting a blog or video series on your site, or something else. Keeping things exciting will energize your members and keep their interest hooked. You can brainstorm with anyone to find something fitting and exciting to try. You could even offer perks to the first ten businesses who tweet or share an idea with you.
<h2 id=""offer"">Offer Benefits</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-9906"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-22.png"" alt="""" width=""574"" height=""577"" />

These can be discounts, early bird registration for events, or useful information in the form of webinars or online material. Furthermore, offering affinity programs at reduced rates will save members time &amp; money and show that they are investing in a membership that is abundant in ROI. These programs can include group benefits, payroll, insurance, merchant services, and other business cost reductions. Think if you could offer a product or service of good value at a lower price than usual. Making savings and providing valuable commodities to your members will prove to them that their membership is worthwhile again and again.
<h2 id=""improve"">Improve Their SEO</h2>
Your members with an online presence might sometimes struggle with SEO. Hosting links on your website that lead to theirs can improve their search rankings making them value their membership as it brings them more business.
<h2 id=""have"">Have Expert Customer Service</h2>
Make sure your customer service is top-notch. People can be easily affected by friendliness and helpfulness, and equally affected by rudeness. Your customer service representatives have to leave a good impression and be easily accessible to attend to the needs of your members. Having a real person available to deal with any queries from your members in real-time is significantly more valuable than having a bot respond in place of a human.
<h2 id=""allow"">Allow Members to Update their Information</h2>
Give members the opportunity to save themselves and your chamber time by allowing them to update their own information. This can be done according to their schedule and will benefit your admins too as they will not have to make multiple changes to every profile over the year. As more chambers add an internet presence and social media platforms, it is more efficient to have members update their listings accordingly.
<h2 id=""take"">Take them to School</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-5316"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/vr-article-copy-6-1024x550.png"" alt="""" width=""1024"" height=""550"" />

Offer exclusive educational opportunities to your members. You are the proprietor of important economic information about your area that you can share on your site for member businesses to access. Keep a steady flow of blog posts, articles, webinars and other materials tailored to educate your member community in ways they wouldn’t be able to without your chamber.
<h2 id=""think"">Think Quality not Quantity</h2>
Because nowadays information is easily accessible through the internet, the quality of the information you offer your members is of top priority. Quality is also whatever your members say it is, so listen to the kind of things they want to be accessing and provide it to them faster than is possible through other channels.
<h2 id=""update"">Update Your Design</h2>
Do not underestimate the value of design. You can add value to a product or service by improving the design. Improve the design of your website and online content - such as blogs, emails, and social media - to make it more visually attractive and simple to use. EventBank can help you in this way by making web design and updates easy!

Read our <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/event-email-marketing-strategies/"">Email Examples</a> article to see how versatile your engagement can get with EventBank.
<h2 id=""provide"">Provide Meaningful Support</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-2047"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/rawpixel-683571-unsplash-1024x683.jpg"" alt=""member engagement"" width=""1024"" height=""683"" />

Focus on ways to help your members in acquiring customers, branding, selling and growing. In order to succeed in this, chambers must be dialed into the community through channels, social media, business relationships, and best practice advising. Jeff Motter, CEO, and chief marketing officer of <a href=""http://eastbaymarketinggroup.com/"">East Bay Marketing Group</a> says “To give real value and actually help the members, I think it's imperative to provide information and resources that teach them how to attract customers in the real world. Get people who know how to generate qualified leads, convert them and repeat the process at-will to come in and show them how to work on their business, not in it.”
<h2 id=""offer2"">Offer Exclusive Promotions</h2>
Promotion opportunities such as allowing member businesses to post discounts on your chamber website for your members to use not only brings revenue to the businesses, but also provides perks for the other chamber members. Having this online community as a secure environment in which to offer deals additionally makes your website more appealing.
<h2 id=""recruit"">Recruit Volunteers from Your Member Community</h2>
Offer positions within the chamber - volunteering positions or even jobs within the chamber can allow members to give back and feel involved, whilst placing them at the center of a networking opportunity. For example, having members volunteer to deliver chamber directories door-to-door will allow them to benefit from connecting with 100s of Chamber members directly.
<h2 id=""post"">Post Job Opportunities</h2>
Have an online job board or career center. Helping members search for jobs in the area or allowing them to sign up for alerts for when new positions become available adds another dimension to your chamber website that makes it valuable to your members. In addition, you could allow member businesses to post jobs on your site, facilitating a hiring process that can otherwise be very costly.
<h2 id=""map"">Map Membership Progress</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1525"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/crm@2x.png"" alt=""CRM, event ROI"" width=""880"" height=""846"" />

Show that you really care about individuals by sending updates and emails about their progress within the chamber. Congratulate them on birthdays, joining anniversaries, and other special events. Showing that you value them will result in them valuing your chamber a lot more.
<h2 id=""say"">Say Thank You</h2>
Acknowledge and reward your stars. Whether it’s employees or members with the largest number of referrals, make sure that they know they are appreciated and an asset to your chamber. Letting members know that they are integral to the success of your chamber will increase their sense of value for their membership.

And finally:
<h2 id=""communicate"">Communicate Your Value</h2>
Explain to your members in direct terms what the tangible value they will gain through their membership. Communicating value is sometimes just as crucial as offering value. Tell your members what company, sector and business size will attend certain events, how many attendees are expected and what they will walk away with at the end of the day. Remind them frequently of the networking and professional development opportunities you can offer, and direct them to the informational and educational benefits your chamber offers.

12309,"6 Ways Digital Transformation Impact Event Attendee Experiences","Digital transformation has become a 21st-century buzzword. It refers to the fast-paced changing dynamics of new technologies, the internet and how we use both to experience the world around us. For event attendees, digital transformation (also known as DX) has the power to transform how we engage with live events and equally provides a new way for event organizers to engage with us.
<h2>What role does digital transformation play in the events industry?</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2059 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/antenna-503044-unsplash-e1531980780853.jpg"" alt=""new attendee experiences"" width=""1380"" height=""920"" />

The events industry has been given a much-needed boost by digital transformation in re-energizing the relationship between organizers and attendees. Boosted by social media, this has its fair share of challenges and opportunities. The chance to improve attendee satisfaction and create a tangible return on investment (ROI) while saving time and resources makes DX the perfect enhancement to any organizer’s toolkit.

70% of respondents to Harvard Business School’s <a href=""https://hbr.org/2019/03/digital-transformation-is-not-about-technology"">study </a>expect digital transformation to affect them significantly, meaning that digitalization will inevitably make its way into the events industry. The trend towards further inclusion also explains event management and automation software consistently ranking as the most<a href=""http://insights.concierge.com/19-event-planning-statistics-for-2019""> important </a>technology to achieving successful outcomes from events.

Game-changing trends are all around us and it doesn’t look like they’re slowing down anytime soon - here are 6 ways to get ahead of the curve in powering new attendee experiences with digital transformation!
<h2>Registration</h2>
<img class=""wp-image-628 size-full aligncenter"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Check-Ins.jpg"" alt=""events registration digital transformation"" width=""984"" height=""406"" />

Sometimes, half the hassle of attending an event occurs before you enter the venue. Registration and entry can at times, be a long-winded, frustrating process which makes it even harder to set the right atmosphere for organizers. Transferring registration to online portals not only creates a cashless system of admittance but allows event organizers to understand who exactly is attending, why, how, when and what with.

Digitalization has provided easy scanning for ticket check-ins which allows organizers to make instant contact prior to the event in case of any last-minute changes. Knowing and communicating with your audience is made easier through apps that can record and monitor direct preferences, making it easier for organizers to respond to the needs of their consumers. This creates satisfied attendees, who can then return and participate in more future events.

Online portals also make it easier to stay in contact with attendees after the event for any further updates and future notices. Extending attendee portals to include managing facilitators and exhibitors makes it’s management function more useful, making it a staple in the event organizer’s toolkit (or pocket, since management and organization can all be done from a simple mobile app).
<h2>Live Streaming</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-12091 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/google-io-2018.jpg"" alt=""live streaming events"" width=""780"" height=""488"" />

Being in two places at once has finally become possible with the introduction of live streaming. For those of us who at times have no choice but to miss events we dearly want to attend, live streaming gives us the option to tune in at the same time whilst not being physically present. Not only does this work famously well for international, well-renowned events, it equally provides a way to boost online social media engagement as long as the users who view the stream are registered beforehand.

Live streaming relies on strong internet and bandwidth that has been tested multiple times because the margin of error can render one group of online attendees completely excluded from the viewing process. Once this has been perfected, anyone can view an event and experience it as if they too are in the room. Many platforms allow it for free, making it a cheap and cheerful option for oversubscribed events. With streaming, you can have hundreds participating in a venue room and thousands watching at home.

<a href=""https://livestream.com/blog/live-video-statistics-livestream"">67%</a> of audiences who watch live streams purchase a ticket to a similar event the next time it occurred, out of the total predicted 82% of all video composed internet traffic by 2020, according to <a href=""https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/visual-networking-index-vni/white-paper-c11-741490.html"">Cisco</a>. Digital transformation has made live streaming the easy go-to for consumers, making it a good choice for the events industry too.
<h2>Virtual and augmented reality</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-235 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/met-vr.jpg"" alt=""digital transformation virtual reality"" width=""1600"" height=""1069"" />

Virtual and augmented reality provides an entirely new dimension to attendee experiences at events. The excitement of entering an alternate universe (not literally) while remaining physically present in the venue is a sure way of creating an immersive attendee experience. Computer generated imagery specifically, (more popularly known as CGI) is making a steady move towards popularity.

On smartphones, Snapchat filters began pushing out the first user experiences of augmented reality. L’Oréal Paris was the first beauty brand to run a Snapchat lens ad to promote its Infallible eyeliner in 2016, a promotion method that has now become commonplace. Virtual and augmented reality can be used to:

Promote an event – Using a virtual venue walk-through created from previous event footage is a great way to show potential visitors what they can expect if they come to your event. Go backstage, talk to speakers and look round the VIP area to give them a proper look.

Lead product demos – Immersing your audience into a VR experience of your brand or products can increase sales. Research shows that AR increases value perception, i.e. when Volvo released the XC90 model, they invited buyers to a VR presentation, viewing a driving simulation through Google Cardboard mobile VR <a href=""https://www.volvocars.com/us/about/our-points-of-pride/google-cardboard"">devices</a>. The campaign helped make the XC90 one of Volvo’s best-selling models.

Taking a leaf from experimental <a href=""https://www.chaostheorygames.com/blog/11-brilliant-digital-experiential-marketing-campaigns"">marketing</a>, VR and AR could be the next key to breaking new frontiers for attendees and hosts together.
<h2>Hire talent with digital skillsets</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15168 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/EB-MTTF_14.jpg"" alt=""transformative leadership forum manila"" width=""1619"" height=""1080"" />

If you recognize your own organization is not fluent in digital technologies and trends, then it might be time to focus some of your digital transfomation at the human level.

If you have talent that's able to bend techology to their will, then you're setting yourself up for a much easier transition knowing that your events are safe in the hands of someone who knows how to get you into the digital realm of event management. Someone that understands and can quickly adapt to new technology is invaluable, as they're likely the spearhead of any digital transformation, and then any follow up digital campaigning that's needed.

As <a href=""https://www.toptal.com/insights/future-of-work/digital-transformation-success"">Toptal</a> remarks, the lack of digital fluency can often times end up being a roadblock for businesses. And if your ability to reach new digital levels of event management and engagement is hindered, so will your event.

And it's not even about cost savings, or efficiency. Those two things are all well and good, but if your audience expects some level of digital engagement, and you're not providing is, you'll be hampering your event's success. Your attendees and your audience dictate the technology your event should be using as touchpoints in their experience, and if you're not able to supply their demand, then you'll likely fall behind similar events who do provide it. Whether it's QR code scanning, event contact directories, online signup, and so on, you'll need to look to their expectations in order to set your own.
<h2>Mobile optimization</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1528 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/check-in-2-phones.jpg"" alt=""mobile events digital transformation"" width=""1620"" height=""1080"" />

All of this depends on mobile optimization. The option to register, attend and experience an event all from the convenience of a small, handheld device can be made or broken by a flimsy internet connection or a page that loads too slowly. Consumers impatience has pushed full optimization to become a requirement, not an option. For any organizer to fulfil these to gain maximum attendee satisfaction, the experience has to be seamless.

The penetration rate for smartphones within the millennial age demographic is 97% for those aged 25-34, followed by Gen Xers aged 35-44 at 96%, according to <a href=""https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2016/millennials-are-top-smartphone-users/"">Nielsen</a>. This means that the chances are, many of you are viewing this very blog on your phones right now. With optimization across devices, mobile is undoubtedly the most important window for accessibility, of course, followed by laptops and tablets.

With the option to expand even further to include devices like Apple Watches, for instance, anything that effectively reduces queue times is a positive signal in the direction of greater ease for attendees.
<h2>Dynamic interaction</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-12090 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Smirnoff_ComicParty-min.jpg"" alt=""dynamic digital events"" width=""700"" height=""466"" />

Nothing is more boring and uninspiring than entering an event and being handed a stack of leaflets and oversized maps to navigate your way to the right area. Digital signage is a way of getting rid of all that paper and wasted time. Turn event programs into an app visitors can download, allowing the same information – maps, schedules, and exhibitor details can be displayed on touchscreens around the venue. Visitors can search these to find exactly what they are looking for, to find exactly where a specific event is taking place.

Thanks to the increased popularity of mobile event apps, signage can build an online community specific to those within the same event. Set up curated Facebook, Twitter and Instagram feed. Use digital signage to prompt visitors to comment on specific exhibits, then have a scrolling feed of their engagement. Attendees photographs and reviews can be displayed on big screens throughout the venue, using audience power to create both an online and real-life ‘buzz’ and drive engagement even more.

The dynamic interaction that digital transformation amplifies deepens the relationship between attendees and organizers but equally connects this directly to the relationship between attendees themselves.

From registration through to live streaming, virtual and augmented reality and mobile optimization, digital transformation is powering attendee experiences in new and experimental ways. New ways of doing things have created strategies for event organizers to strengthen their relationship with attendees and as a result, these five trends are in the lead. Kitting your own event out in full <a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/event-tech-guide/"">tech </a>is becoming easier and easier and it’s only a matter of time before it becomes even more widespread.

Making digital transformation work for your events is a way of continuing to interact with your attendees, but in a new way altogether. Here’s to new beginnings!

12330,"Success Story: How AnzCham Philippines Consolidated Databases with EventBank","This success story is a result of feedback received from the Australia-New Zealand Chamber of Commerce in the Philipines where a solution was needed to help synchronize attendee databases onto one platform. The responses are a result of success with EventBank tackling this mass-migration, which had delighted AnzCham with it’s user friendliness and breadth of features, including event page creation, ticketing, mobile apps, and 24/7 support.
<h2>Too Many Cooks in the Kitchen</h2>
AnzChamber Philippines for a long period of time had relied on engaging their members and communities through a myriad of tools offered across the web. While many SaaS models are scalable, as well as versatile in their functions, contact databases can sometimes get stretched thin and eventually data on one tool may be different from another, and unless a master sheet is painstakingly maintained, the tools that once helped to maximize your work, can begin harming your engagement and communication.

Like the adage goes, you never want too many cooks in the kitchen. In AnzCham Philippine’s situation, the cooks are the tools and kitchen is the database strategy. With so many tools inflicting contact data changes on a day-to-day or campaign-to-campaign basis, the dissonance in accuracy can create headaches down the line as digital engagement in this day and age relies heavily on personalization.

&nbsp;

<iframe src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/ckW2kYPJ2vI"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe>
<h2></h2>
<h2>The Results</h2>
After AnzCham Philippine’s was contacted by EventBank during it’s Philippines expansion efforts, the match was clear after a few events were run under the EventBank platform. With EventBank’s all-in-one methodology towards chambers of commerce and their database issues, organizations that run on memberships can utilize many tools like membership CRM, email marketing, event web-page builders, and more. All of the included tools in the EventBank Platform would normally be offered by third-party developers and for the databases to be stay on the same page, integrations would be necessary.

However, due to API support lacking in many stages, or integrations not existing between two tools for any reason, dissonance in database contacts can occur.

EventBank takes these necessary tools and combines them into an easy-to-use platform where all the modules and features are integrated natively, and operate off of one, and only one database. Leading to a healthier contact list that is updated frequently without splitting up contact lists across different tools.

In response to using EventBank since as early as February 2019, AnzChamber has only praise for its user-friendliness, and ability to harmonize their database into one place, saving time, energy, and headaches for the chamber, no matter how big or complex the event or promotion campaign may be.

15164,"EventBank Discusses Transformative Leadership with Top Association Leaders","<em>In the face of constant change, breakthroughs and disruption the question becomes: how can association leaders head the change?</em>

EventBank recently held three forums titled <em>Moving into the Future: Transformative Association Leadership Forum</em> in Manila, Singapore and Hong Kong. Top association leaders were invited to discuss how the accelerated pace of 21st century change redefining the qualities of a good leader in associations.

The packed agenda featured industry presentations on the importance of volunteer engagement; setting up, managing and moving new ideas forward; how to future-proof associations using creativity and innovation; and a thought-provoking panel discussion addressing some of the biggest challenges in leadership today such as millennial leadership, encouraging wider representation of women in leadership roles and how leaders are preparing or addressing the shifts shaping associations today.

On the importance of transformational leadership for associations, keynote speakers’<strong> Bobby Peralta</strong> (CEO and co-founder of the Philippine Council of Associations and Association Executives) <strong>Ann Yom Steel</strong> (Executive Director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Singapore) and <strong>Mauricio Lozano</strong> (President of The Mexican Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong) shared:
<blockquote><em>“In grade school, I remember my teacher telling me that to learn and lead in life, the important “3R’s” are reading, (w)riting and (a)rithmetic. In the association world based on my experience, the essential “3R’s” to learn and lead are relevance, relationships and resources.”</em> Bobby Peralta

<em>'“Having a strategic vision for the organization, rallying the team around a common purpose, and leading with authenticity, to me, are core elements of a transformational leadership. In a non-profit organization, assessing gaps and limitations in the organization and applying situational leadership in my experience has been the fastest way to build momentum for drive transformations for the organization.”</em> Ann Yom Steel

<em>""Transformational leadership is the courage to transcend an organization into a new stage that is better suited to take advantage of developing trends and capture future growth. Associations need to continuously adapt and transform to ensure survival and growth in today's fast paced environment. In a world where the majority seeks to pass off responsibility, leadership is the willingness to be responsible for actions, whether conventional or unconventional, that will ultimately transform any association."" </em>Mauricio Lozano</blockquote>

15221,"How to Find the Perfect Event Venue: A 10-Step Guide","Whether for business or pleasure, events require careful planning, attention to detail and focus on the right priorities. Finding the right venue can make or break an event, so it's important that you find the perfect venue to house your event. But how do you find the perfect event venue?

The concept of the perfect event venue may currently seem out of reach and unrealistic, but with this 10-step guide, you are guaranteed to find the right venue for you. So, although finding the perfect venue will always take time, it doesn’t always have to feel overwhelming.

Your budget will be one of the biggest considerations that you will have to take into account when finding an event venue. A price range will immediately limit which venues you can use for your event. You should be aware of the limitations of your financial resources from the get-go so that you’re not tempted to overspend if you see a venue that is perfect, but out of your price range. Remember your budget has to cover more than just your venue, so overspending here will mean that you have to compromise on another aspect of your event.

However, if you can be flexible on the date of the event, don’t be afraid to negotiate. Certain days of the week usually cost less than others, so with date flexibility comes the possibility of a cheaper price.

Finally, always make sure that you confirm all agreed times, dates, costs and any other details in a written contract.
<h2 id=""capacity"">Capacity</h2>
Venue capacity is another important factor to consider when choosing an event space. An event of 500 people would not fit comfortably in a venue that only holds 300, not to mention there are fire and safety codes that the venue has to abide by. So, be sure to find a venue that will <strong>comfortably fit your expected audience</strong>.

If you are holding an event that accepts not only pre-registered guests but also walk-in guests, it’s always better to overestimate your capacity than underestimate. Should you be expecting 200 guests, it would be wise to find a venue with a capacity of 250 to 300 guests. Another option for walk-in events are venues with <strong>breakout rooms</strong>. These are separate rooms that can be used if the number of people exceeds the capacity of the main area. Although not ideal, it is possible (with the right planning and equipment) to stream the main event to these breakout rooms.
<h2 id=""location"">Location and Accessibility</h2>
When it comes to location, <strong>convenience</strong> is key. If the location of the event is inconvenient, be that in terms of price or travel distance, potential attendees may be dissuaded from attending the event. For a local event, you’ll want to look for a venue within a reasonable distance from most attendees’ homes, but for an event that requires people to travel further afield, a venue near their hotels or the airport would be ideal. Of course, you will have chosen the venue before you know where people will be staying, so to help out your potential attendees you could give them recommendations on hotels and accommodation near to the venue.

<strong>Accessibility</strong> is also another important factor to consider when finding an event venue. For some events you won’t yet know who your attendees are, but if you have booked similar events before you can check previous attendees’ requirements and perhaps use this to assess what kind of accessibility you may need for your coming event. An accessibility requirement that you may need to consider is wheelchair access.

Fortunately for you, <a href=""https://blog.capterra.com/how-to-find-a-venue-for-an-event/"">venue search engines</a> are the perfect tool for finding the perfect venue worldwide as well as the top conference destinations.
<h2 id=""transportation"">Transportation and Parking</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2147 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/transportation.jpeg"" alt=""Transportation"" width=""1500"" height=""795"" />

Another aspect to take into consideration is <strong>transport links</strong> to and from the event venue. Is it easily accessible by public transport? If not, you will have to think of other means of transporting your guests to and from the venue (which could become an additional, unnecessary cost). However, if it is easily accessible by public transport, remember to provide your attendees with information on how to find the venue.

You will also have to inquire whether the venue provides parking as, in most cases, a large majority of attendees will drive to the venue. If there isn’t parking, be sure to research the surrounding areas for car parks that can be used by your attendees.
<h2 id=""wifi"">WiFi Capabilities</h2>
WiFi connectivity is a must for most any event, both for the host and the attendees. As the host, you will need WiFi for multiple purposes. These purposes may include streaming video, checking-in guests and social media uses, to name a few, so it’s vital that you have a fast and secure WiFi connection. The best venues will have <strong>dedicated WiFi</strong> access for you and your guests, but this is something you should inquire about in order to be certain. The <strong>WiFi speed</strong> also matters, so be sure to ask the venue about their speeds and if they would allow you to test the speed of their network to be sure.
<h2 id=""amenities"">Amenities</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-991 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/yangfan-gan-224769.jpg"" alt=""how to avoid low attendance of your events"" width=""1599"" height=""1080"" />

Different venues are able to provide different levels of services and facilities, so it’s important when booking your venue that you make sure they can cater to your specific needs. Amenities you may want to consider inquiring about include:
<ul>
 	<li style=""list-style-type: none;"">
<ul>
 	<li>A/V Equipment</li>
 	<li>Tables and Chairs</li>
 	<li>Catering</li>
 	<li>Set-up/clean-up crew</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
All of these services can be provided by outside sources, but if your prospective venue offers them, you may be able to get a packaged deal that saves you money and the hassle of trying to organize different services through separate companies.
<h2 id=""ambiance"">Ambiance and Style</h2>
In order to find the perfect event venue, you need to define the style and ambiance of your event. This will help you to understand the type of venue that would best suit your event. The more the ambiance matches the desired feeling of your event, the less decorating you’ll need to do to achieve the right atmosphere. Therefore, when you are choosing your venue take note of its ambiance and consider whether it matches the desired style of your event.
<h2 id=""layout"">Layout</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-10803 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Banquet-Style.png"" alt=""Pod event layout"" width=""634"" height=""450"" />

Although simple and easily skipped over, the layout of your event is key to making it memorable. Depending on the type of event you are organizing you may want different layouts, so you’ll want to have a rough idea of what activities you will be hosting and what layout these activities may require. Depending on the activities you have planned, you could choose a boardroom, lecture space, dining layout or any other layout that suits your event. Many venues are flexible with the layout of their rooms and can adapt to different types of events, but even so, you’ll want to get a floor plan of the venue and a confirmation that they are able to provide your desired layout.

Check out our blog <a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/event-room-layouts/"">7 Event Room Layouts that Encourage Networking</a> for more ideas on what layout would be the right one for your event.
<h2 id=""insurance"">Insurance</h2>
Insurance may not be something you would consider a necessity when finding a venue, but some venues will <strong>refuse to do business</strong> with you if you don’t have insurance. Certain venues require a set amount of liability as well as being named as additional insured for the event before agreeing to host your event. Therefore, you should get an endorsement for your event from your insurance agent before starting your venue search so you don’t experience unexpected delays that could put you behind schedule.
<h2 id=""timeframe"">Timeframe</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-10054 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-36.png"" alt=""timeframe"" width=""1130"" height=""738"" />

<strong>The sooner</strong> you start looking for your venue <strong>the better</strong>. You’ll first need to know these three things; your budget, an estimated event size, and space requirements. Once you have an approximate idea of these three things you can start searching for your venue. Beginning your search well in advance of your event will give you a far larger selection of venues. This is because venues are less likely to have already been booked for your preferred date, and furthermore, the cost of the venue will be significantly lower.

You should book your venue at least <strong>4-6 months</strong> in advance to allow yourself sufficient time to organize other aspects of the event and allow for any potential unexpected delays.

<h2>Back to You</h2>
Although finding the perfect event venue will always take time, with clear goals in mind and a clear idea of what you need to focus on, it can be an enjoyable endeavor, not to mention, a rewarding one.

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s a game of appealing to what people want to look at, listen to, feel, taste, do, or share.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And just as important as </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">what </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">people are paying attention to is </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">where</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> their attention is directed. In 2019, we spend a lot of time looking at our phones, and it's doubtful this will change in 2020.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s reflected in the way marketers work—much has changed since the initial dot com boom of the 90s. In fact, </span><strong><a href=""https://learn.g2.com/branding-statistics"">72% of marketers</a></strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> say that branded online content is a better investment than buying ad space in magazines.

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Social media is a necessary part of any event marketing strategy. With so many built-in ways to market your event on social, using your platforms to brand your events should be a no-brainer. Here are 8 tips on how to utilize those resources for branding.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The first step in branding an event is to make sure you’re doing it on the right social media outlet. If you expect an older crowd at your event, getting them to engage with your brand on Snapchat might not be a great idea. Are your attendees on Instagram or Twitter? If your brand is more professional, Linkedin might be your best bet. If your attendees are already networking on Facebook, consider creating your own </span><a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/tips-effective-networking-event/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Facebook group</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> for them to talk about your event and brand, or </span><a href=""https://learn.g2.com/how-to-create-an-event-on-facebook""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">create a Facebook event</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to centralize the conversation. Figure out where your target audience is on social and build your strategy from there.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On the flip side, choosing the wrong platform could have a negative impact on your brand—people will think you’re out of touch with where potential event attendees live online. You wouldn’t want to have to create a new social media account on a new platform in order to receive updates and content from an event you’re attending, would you? No matter what, make it your goal to know your audience and use social media accordingly. </span>
<h2 id=""hashtag""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">2. Create Your Own Hashtag</span></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hashtags are labels for internet content. They make it easy to find and keep track of posts about a given topic, and they are easy for event attendees to share. You can create your own unique hashtag to help brand your event.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Think of a hashtag that works with your brand and the branding strategy of your event. If the event repeats annually, you can use a hashtag that incorporates the year, then change it for your next event.  </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Make sure your hashtag is short and memorable because part of using hashtags to brand your events on social media is getting other people to use it. If it’s something catchy and clever, they will remember it and want to use it in their posts. This way, the event-related content people share on social will instantly be branded with your hashtag. Even if they don't know it, every attendee can be a brand ambassador. Additionally, the content posted under the hashtag can provide you with user-generated content to use for future marketing.</span>
<h2 id=""account""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">3. Brand Your Accounts</span></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your followers know your logo—they see it in your profile icon every time they look at a post from your account. If you change it, chances are they will notice, and it will spark curiosity. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Change the header image on your Twitter or Facebook page, update your </span><a href=""https://learn.g2.com/youtube-banner-size""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">YouTube banner channel art</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, and include the branding and hashtag from your event in it. Even changing the background color of your icon on any social account can help create a little bit of buzz (and when it comes to event marketing, you’re in the buzz business).</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Make sure to include a link to and description of your event in your bio as well—that way you can convert curious followers into attendees. Once the event has started, stay on top of branding. Consider creating a custom </span><a href=""https://learn.g2.com/how-to-make-a-snapchat-geofilter""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Snapchat geofilter</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> for attendees to share to their followers when they’re at the event. It could be as fun or as subtle as you see fit.</span>
<h2 id=""content""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">4. Share branded Content</span></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Content and social media go hand in hand. What good is content if you have no place to share it? What good is social media if you have nothing to show off? Creating event-related content before, during, and after your event is essential to generating hype and selling more tickets.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Does your company have a blog? Write an article outlining how great your event is going to be, and share it out on social media. Create a piece around places to eat or things to see while the attendees are in the area if you are expecting a large out-of-town attendance. You can also share content created by your speakers or do a </span><a href=""https://www.adamenfroy.com/guest-blogging""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">guest blog post</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to get your followers interested in what they have to say. Use their star power and insight to promote the event—people will be eager to hear that they’re all about.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You can get <a href=""https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instasize-photo-editor-video/id576649830"">creative with the content</a> you’re sharing too—it doesn’t always have to be a blog post! Create something interactive like a Spotify playlist themed around your event—you can even add your logo to it for extra branding.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ticket giveaways are another useful </span><a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/event-promotion-ideas/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">event promotion idea</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, and social media is a perfect platform. You can ask your followers to share content with your hashtag or tag friends who might also want to attend the event in exchange for a chance at a free ticket. You’ll create more brand awareness, gain more potential followers, and more attendees. </span>
<h2 id=""influencers""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">5. Link Up with Influencers</span></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While promoting your hashtag to your regular social media users and attendees can help generate buzz for your event, reaching out to influencers and asking them to share your hashtag and attend your event can supercharge your brand’s presence on social media. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You might have a lot of followers on your social accounts, but influencers have large networks and can meet their followers on a level that brands cannot. Combine your networks to make a giant supernetwork of buzz around your brand. Influencers can promote your brand with nary more than a hashtag and a selfie.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Offering a complimentary admission in exchange for social content from influencers is a good way to make sure your influencer </span><a href=""https://blog.useproof.com/growth-strategies/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">marketing strategy</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> works.</span>
<h2 id=""conversation""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">6. Start a Conversation</span></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You’ve got your hashtag. You’ve got influencers on board. You have an event coming up and you want people to talk about it. You want them to talk about it before the event to generate buzz as well as during the event to ensure anyone who missed out has FOMO—an emotional marketing tactic that appeals to </span><a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/millennial-event-engagement/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">millennials</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. You also want them to talk after the event to share memorable moments.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you’ve got some insightful speakers or a super cool location, give your followers an opportunity to let you know what they think. Make sure to include your hashtag when you make conversation-sparking posts. People coming to your event will be talking about it anyway, and a good way to get attendees to engage with your brand is to initiate conversations on social.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is also a good way to remain accessible. Guests will undoubtedly have questions leading up to the event, and keeping up with conversations on social is a good way to notice and answer them properly.</span>
<h2 id=""swagbag""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">7. Pass Out Shareable Giveaways </span></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3149 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/swag-bag@2x.png"" alt=""swag bag ideas"" width=""1920"" height=""1003"" />

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A great way to brand your events using social media is to put things in front of your attendees that they cannot resist sharing. People love freebies, and </span><a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/swag-bag-ideas/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">swag bags</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> are a surefire way to get them excited about your event and brand. Tote bags and t-shirts are great, but if you give attendees something more special like a branded toy or some cool sunglasses, they will be more likely to want to post about it to their social networks.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If it fits the tone of your event as well as your budget, photobooth photos are a great giveaway. Set up your photo booth with a branded backdrop (just like the red carpet!) and consider bringing some on-brand props for attendees to pose with. You can design the print-out to be branded as well. Photobooth pictures are more fun than a simple selfie or group picture on a phone, so they are more likely to be shared, not to mention, they’re a cute keepsake that will remind attendees of your event for years to come.</span>
<h2 id=""retweet""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">8. Retweet Your Attendees</span></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5906 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_7533-Edit.jpg"" alt=""Keeping members happy"" width=""1920"" height=""1080"" />

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it comes to event marketing and social media, you can’t just set it and forget it. You have to stay engaged with your followers. Share the best hashtagged posts from speakers and attendees on your pages. You might also consider creating a roundup-style blog post including the best takeaways from your followers. Whatever you do, make sure you have an idea of your post-event strategy and keep track of what people are saying on social during the process.</span>
<h2>Stay Social</h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Branding your events using social media comes down to paying attention to what attendees are paying attention to. You need to make sure you have a game plan that includes plenty of content and conversation surrounding your event and brand. Remember that your guests are already trying to network amongst themselves, and you can help facilitate those conversations on social media. You’ll create brand awareness at the same time if you follow these tips for using social media to brand your events.</span>

<h2 id=""personal"">Be Personal</h2>
Think about it this way, membership engagement is important to you, so it would stand to reason that your engagement is important to them. Like their posts, share their posts, comment, answer questions, doing all of this will make your members feel like you’re interested in what they have to say and what they’re doing. This will build a real sense of community between you and your members that will encourage their engagement.
<h2 id=""proactive"">Be Proactive</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2408 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/nordwood-themes-359015-unsplash-e1538550196777-1024x522.jpg"" alt=""Connect"" width=""1024"" height=""522"" />

Social media is the perfect platform for growing your membership. Take advantage of it! To grow your chamber’s Facebook membership use the “invite friends” feature. Invite a dozen or so friends a day and slowly see your Facebook contacts expand over the course of several weeks. This technique is based on your friend group being chamber members and others interested in the chamber.
<h2 id=""consistent"">Be Consistent</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-648 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/blogging-1024x682.jpg"" alt=""blogging email marketing"" width=""1024"" height=""682"" />

The people with the largest number of subscriptions, friends, and followers on social media will all tell you that posting on a regular basis is key to keeping people engaged. Right now, this may seem hugely time-consuming and hard to keep up with, but if you make it a habit, it will become a small part of your daily routine. I’d recommend using the tabs feature of your browser. Opening up the same tabs every morning and engaging with your members will quickly become a habit that you no longer have to consciously remind yourself of.
<h2 id=""respectful"">Be Respectful</h2>
As important as it is to post regularly, be aware of not posting too much, too often. Posting too much will cause you to block up people’s feeds and discourage them from engaging with you. People like variety on their feeds, they don’t want to constantly see posts from the same account. If they're seeing too much content from your account they’ll stop engaging with your content, they'll just see your account name and continue scrolling or worse, they'll unfollow you.
<h2 id=""interesting"">Be Interesting</h2>
This may seem obvious, but I’m going to say it anyway, post things that people want to read. It’s no use posting every day if the content of your posts isn’t something that interests people or makes them want to read on. They'll scroll straight past your post and feel no need to engage with you. I can’t stress enough how important it is that you know your target audience well and know the kind of content they engage with. This is easy enough to track by looking at your previous posts and the amount of engagement they inspired.
<h2 id=""informative"">Be Informative</h2>
Being informative is an easy way for chambers to engage their audience. Posting recommendations about a digital tool or app, posting about the weather forecast or even posting a traffic report, all of these are useful for your members. Posting something like the weather forecast regularly can attract a real following as members will come to your account to check the weather. This will also have a knock-on effect; when they come to your account to check the weather, other posts may also catch their eye and further encourage them to frequent your social media pages.
<h2 id=""fun"">Be Fun</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-12099 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/refinary-29-rooms.jpg"" alt=""Refinary 29 rooms events marketing example"" width=""760"" height=""500"" />

As important as it is to be informative, it’s also crucial that your social media feed is fun. One of the main reasons people use social media is to entertain themselves. People use social media as a means of escape and a reprieve from work, so it’s important that your social media account allows them to do these things.

But remember that it doesn’t always have to be just one or the other, fun or informative, you can create posts that mix the two together. For instance, posting a quiz about your chamber and its members. This is both informative and fun as members test their knowledge in an engaging way.
<h2 id=""prompt"">Be Prompt</h2>
Engagement in real-time on your part is vital in encouraging member engagement. If you don’t respond promptly to a comment or post, member engagement is much harder to maintain. The longer you leave a comment before responding, the more member engagement decreases.
<h2 id=""talkative"">Be Talkative</h2>
Don’t just “like” comments made on your posts, comment back! Of course, it’s much less time consuming to go down the list of comments liking them all, but with a simple comment, you can engage with members and build a dialog. Then from this, you can build a relationship. There’s another bonus to this; the algorithms will see that your post is generating meaningful engagement and as a reward, your post may get more reach.
<h2 id=""prepared"">Be Prepared</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2176 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/international_5-1024x586.jpeg"" alt=""Schedule"" width=""1024"" height=""586"" />

To make posting on a regular basis even easier, you can prepare your social media posts in advance. Scheduling posts doesn’t make you impersonal as long as you engage in real-time. So, schedule in advance; engage in real-time.

There are many systems you as a chamber can use to schedule your posts, but some of the easiest and best to use are actually those built into social media platforms. Both Facebook and Twitter have built-in tools to schedule your posts and tweets.

You can also use a third-party scheduler to schedule and recycle evergreen content. One that is much recommended, and that I would recommend to you, is <a href=""http://smarterqueue.com"">smarterqueue</a>. It will make posting on social media far less time-consuming for your chamber.
<h2 id=""real"">Be Real</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-10169 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-41.png"" alt=""Chambers Social Media"" width=""790"" height=""503"" />

Although I recommend scheduling your posts in advance and using the relevant tools to help you do this, don’t blast the same message everywhere! A post that would be effective on Instagram would not be suited to Twitter or Facebook. There is nothing worse than seeing Twitter hashtags in a Facebook post, it shows a lack of care about relationships, it's obviously just advertising. So, be real and be human.
<h2 id=""current"">Be Current</h2>
Preparing your posts in advance makes posting on your social media a far less time-consuming process, but be careful not to prepare them too far in advance! People aren’t interested in old news, so make sure that you’re not preparing so far in advance that when your posts are uploaded they are already considered outdated. Also, don’t let your schedule restrict you. If something unexpected and news-worthy happens in your chamber, don’t wait to post about it because you already have a post scheduled for that day, post anyway! Doing extra posts does no harm so long as you’re not inundating people with posts.
<h2 id=""interactive"">Be Interactive</h2>
We’ve already discussed the importance of engaging in real-time by commenting and liking people’s posts, but as a chamber, you obviously want to continually encourage member engagement with your posts. A simple, yet effective way of encouraging this interaction is a “caption this” post. This is something that is seen all the time on social media, primarily Instagram, but it’s easy to forget how effective this really is. Statistics prove that images alone drive stronger engagement, so why not boost that engagement even more by encouraging people to engage by trying to think of the best caption for your post.

Bonus, this also means that you have one less caption to come up with which makes your life just that little bit easier too.
<h2 id=""seasonal"">Be Seasonal</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2729 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/vbox6089__P7A9188_182859_small-1024x683.jpg"" alt=""Seasonal"" width=""1024"" height=""683"" />

Seasonal holidays and events are something all chambers should take advantage of. With all the public holidays that we celebrate around the world, it would be silly not to use them to your benefit. The calendar is filled with celebrations of food, pets and other special things people love. They are great opportunities to have some fun and engage your members!

<a href=""https://frankjkenny.com/social-media-post-ideas-for-fall/"">Check out</a> some autumnal ideas for chambers to post on social media.
<h2 id=""advice"">Be a Source of Advice</h2>
People use social media for many different things, one of which is for advice. So, to encourage engagement and draw people to your social media account, post advice and recommendations. This could be advice on finding a job, which events to attend, where to go in the local area. This way you can also promote your members by sharing job postings at member companies, events being hosted by members, etc.
<h2 id=""promoter"">Be a Promoter</h2>
On that note, we can’t forget the main reason chambers are using social media; to promote yourselves and your members. So, although many of your posts should be content-driven, you also need to be promoting yourselves in the process. Nice ideas for self-promotion that don’t come across as just advertisements are; sharing when your chamber achieves a goal, “what I love most about the chamber is...”, event reminders, event countdowns, and event sponsor thank-yous, etc. Ideas for member promotion include; welcoming new members, recognizing membership renewals, spotlighting members who volunteer, etc.
<h2>Back to You</h2>
Now with these tips and tricks in mind, go liven up your social media accounts! But don’t forget social media isn’t the only way to engage your members, email is still a very effective way of attracting and engaging members.

<h2 id=""design"">Great Overall Design</h2>
<img class=""wp-image-971 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/chamberwebsite-mockup-screenshot-e1507197298437.png"" alt=""New Chamber Website Solution f"" width=""1159"" height=""619"" />

Great overall design is the first chamber website must-have. The design and usability of your website will have an impact on perceived value and trust levels; the better your website design and usability, the more people believe in your credibility.

The key to building an excellent online reputation for your chamber is to provide a good looking website that always functions perfectly. The color scheme should be well-defined, the layout and topography consistent, images clear, and the content easy to read.
<h2 id=""cms"">Easy-to-Use Content Management Systems</h2>
<img class=""size-medium wp-image-15458 aligncenter"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Content-Management-System-CMS-EventBank-Website-Solutions-317x204.png"" alt=""Chamber of Commerce Website Solutions"" width=""317"" height=""204"" />

&nbsp;

Your content management system (CMS) is the backbone of your design. It needs to be easy to use, search engine friendly, and include the functionality needed to provide your community with everything they need to engage with your website.

Your CMS should include a publishing platform that is easy to use, allowing both your chamber and your members to publish relevant news. It should also have key functionality which includes the ability to categorize content, an easy-to-use directory, event listings, etc.
<h2 id=""seo"">Search Engine Optimization</h2>
Search engine optimization (SEO) is another one of the top chamber website must-haves. Research consistently finds that more than 90% of online interactions begin with the use of a search engine. Therefore, you must establish foundational SEO elements throughout the design and development of your website.

<h2 id=""menu"">Navigable Menu Items</h2>
Navigation within your website should be intuitive and allow visitors to easily move from one page to the next. An easy way to test the navigability of your website is to ask someone who didn’t design the website to find out when your next event is and how to join. If they can’t find this out in three minutes or less, this shows your website is difficult to navigate.
<h2 id=""mobile-friendly"">Mobile-Friendly Design</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-10052 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-34-1024x661.png"" alt=""Chamber Website Must-Haves Mobile Friendly"" width=""1024"" height=""661"" />

These days, websites are accessed as often by mobile as they are by computer. Therefore, it’s essential that your website is mobile-friendly. To ensure that your website looks great and functions flawlessly on any device, the site needs to be built upon a responsive framework.
<h2 id=""search"">Search</h2>
A search bar option is a must-have for those who prefer to get right to the point versus browsing through menu selections. But remember it’s vital that you get an intuitive search bar that will improve user experience, there's no point having a search bar of mediocre quality.
<h2 id=""welcome"">Welcome Message</h2>
Featuring a welcome message from the Board President or other executive member of the chamber enables you to provide readers with absolute and positive reasons to join your chamber. It should also demonstrate exactly how they will benefit from their association with your chamber.

When writing your welcome message, try to avoid fancy words, clichés, and broad statements. Instead state clearly the chamber’s mission in a strong, problem-solution statement.
<h2 id=""join"">Join Now</h2>
Potential members who visit your website should encounter a seamless sign-up process that allows them to join at any time 24/7. A clear and concise action button should be included on every page with a link that will take them to the registration form and method of payment. If the sign-up process isn't seamless or the page easy to find, potential members may be discouraged from signing-up!
<h2 id=""contact"">Contact Information</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3035 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/email-3249062_1280-1024x573.png"" alt=""association management software automation"" width=""1024"" height=""573"" />

All of your contact information should be available on your website so people can easily reach out to you with any questions or queries. This should include a mailing address, email addresses, and phone numbers. It’s equally important that you try to ensure that all contact information elsewhere on the internet is the same so that your chamber is consistently recognized.
<h2 id=""directory"">Directory with a Map</h2>
To drive community engagement, you should offer a document with comprehensive information about businesses and landmarks in the community. This can be done in one of three ways; alphabetically, categorically, or by date of membership. The most user-friendly is to provide the directory in two formats - alphabetically and by category - because this allows users to search by either company name or industry.
<h2 id=""up-to-date"">Up-to-date Content</h2>
It’s imperative that all of your information is up-to-date, whether it’s information from inside or outside of your chamber. This way your website can become an important community-wide resource that informs people of what is happening throughout the community.
<h2 id=""event"">Event Page</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-12091 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/google-io-2018.jpg"" alt=""Google events marketing example"" width=""780"" height=""488"" />

Your event page is a chamber website must-have as it can help bring different aspects of the community together. In addition to a community-wide calendar of events, you should showcase the events specific to your chamber as well as highlight the next upcoming event. Once again remember to make sure that your event calendar is kept up-to-date!
<h2 id=""profiles"">Member Profile Page</h2>
A member profile page is one of the essential chamber website must-haves. This is because networking within communities is essential to the success of any business. Having a member profile page that includes company names, logos, services or products offered, contact information and a map showing their location will make your website a valuable resource for members and visitors alike.
<h2 id=""membership"">Membership Page</h2>
Having a membership page will help tell the story of your chamber and provide information to drive new membership. This page should include; the history of your chamber, reasons why someone should become a member, member testimonials, and a list of board members.
<h2 id=""staff"">Staff Page</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5307 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boy-2026064_1280-1024x512.png"" alt=""diversity people"" width=""1024"" height=""512"" />

Although this page may not always be considered essential to a chamber website, it is in fact very important. People like to know who they’re connecting with and this page will add some personality to your website that will encourage new memberships.
<h2 id=""pictures"">Pictures and Videos</h2>
This page is most certainly a chamber website must-have! Studies have shown that while people only remember 20% of what they read, they remember 80% of the images they see.

Having photos and videos of your community will bring your chamber and neighborhood to life. But please remember to feature only high-quality images and videos. There’s nothing worse than a blurry photo or video!
<h2 id=""blog"">Blog</h2>
A blog page is one of the most important chamber website must-haves! It’s a way for you to both acquire new readers and retain regulars to your site. Moreover, providing high-quality content on a regular basis will have a positive impact on your number of membership leads.

Another bonus of blogging is the increased ability to gain local links that will help you earn rankings with search engines. Companies who blog receive 97% more links to their website than those who don't.
<h2 id=""social"">Social Integration</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15303 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/eventbank-exploration-patterns-8-copy-8@2x.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Links to your social media pages are a must-have! The simple act of being able to share and like your chamber’s content will increase community engagement. But only list the social media accounts that you post to regularly. If your link leads to a page that doesn't have recently added content, people may wonder if you’re still around.

You should include social share buttons on pages such as your event page and blog page. This encourages members to share events they’re attending or blog posts they found interesting.
<h2 id=""faq"">FAQ Page</h2>
A FAQ page is crucial as it offers a timely resolution to common questions. It should be a source from which viewers can quickly find out more about your chamber and community.

Tip: use a conversational tone and active voice to create a comfortable forum.
<h2 id=""advertising"">Advertising</h2>
Establishing a way for businesses to advertise on your website is a great way to drive revenue growth for your chamber. You can sell space on your website for banners, sponsored content, and sponsorships for different events.

You can also offer mentions and spotlights of local business members on your social media accounts.
<h2>Now it’s Your Turn</h2>
Now that you know these 20 chamber website must-haves, check your website, do you have all of the above? If not, add it in! And please never forget how important your website is for encouraging new memberships and retaining old ones!

Offering organizations and companies advertising opportunities is a great source of non-dues revenue for your association. According to a report by Avenue M Group in 2017, <strong>49%</strong> of associations benefit from revenue from mobile app advertising and <strong>21%</strong> from social media advertising.
<h3>On Your Website and Mobile App</h3>
Your website and mobile app are both great platforms on which you can offer advertising space. Offering digital banners as advertising space is a savvy way for your association to bring in extra revenue.
<h3>On Your Social Media</h3>
Your social media is another platform on which you can offer organizations advertising space. However, only offer social media advertising if you have a strong following to make the fee you charge worthwhile.
<blockquote><strong>Top Tip.</strong> Don’t forget to promote yourself! The most successful associations promote themselves through advertising.</blockquote>
<h2 id=""events"">Events and Fundraising</h2>

Events and Fundraising are often considered one of the top methods of generating non-dues revenue for your association. Although hosting an event can be expensive, if done well an event will more than break even and with <a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/fundraising-ideas/"">creative fundraising ideas</a>, you are guaranteed to blow past your goal.
<h3>Events</h3>
Events offer many opportunities to generate non-dues revenue as well as offering a premium membership experience. You can charge for events and make your members feel valued by giving them a discounted rate. You can also charge for advertisements and sponsorships as well as exhibitor booths.
<h3>Fundraising</h3>
<a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/fundraising-ideas/"">Fundraising ideas</a> will also help your association to generate non-dues revenue. These ideas may include raffles, door prizes or even a tournament. A fundraiser such as a golf tournament allows you to charge an entry fee for those who wish to compete and sell tickets to those who want to attend.
<blockquote><strong>Top Tip.</strong> Make sure the events you’re hosting interest your members! Remember your members will be working professionals, so your events should be an opportunity for them to network.</blockquote>
<h2 id=""sponsorships"">Sponsorships</h2>

Due to the fact, your members are highly-skilled professionals, businesses will pay a premium to access them. And lucky for you, you can offer them that access while, simultaneously, generating non-dues revenue for your association. Sponsorship opportunities include events, webinars, and scholarships
<h3>Event Sponsorships</h3>
Companies will be keen to sponsor your events in order to reach your members. You can offer an event sponsor advertising on your event page as well as at the event itself. You can also offer sponsors an exhibitor booth at the event.
<blockquote><strong>Top Tip.</strong> When approaching potential sponsors, remember to choose companies that fit with your values and offer your members a legitimate service.</blockquote>

<h3>Sales</h3>

<h3>Marketing</h3>
Not only is merchandise an effective way of generating non-dues income, it’s also a form of marketing. Merchandise puts an association’s brand out into the world. So, essentially it’s a form of advertising that just keeps on giving.
<blockquote><strong>Top Tip.</strong> Don’t just go for the obvious merchandise ideas! Think of what your members use in their business as well as their everyday life, and brand it.</blockquote>

Creating a job board on your website not only gives your association another source of non-dues revenue, it also serves as a member benefit.

Providing education opportunities for your members is the perfect source of non-dues revenue for your association. Remember your members are career-driven professionals who want to further their career and are prepared to take any opportunity to so.
<h3>E-Learning Platforms</h3>
According to <a href=""https://madgex.com/labs/knowledge-hub/blog/maximizing-non-dues-revenue"">Madgex Labs</a>, the Online Learning Market is predicted to reach $325 billion by 2025. As an association with access to ambitious professionals constantly looking to improve their career, this is something you should take advantage of. Running online courses with a registration fee is a clever way to generate non-dues revenue while at the same time providing value for your members.
<h3>Certification</h3>
With the job market becoming increasingly competitive, professionals in your industry want to ensure they have the best credentials. Therefore, offering certifications and accreditation programs is a great source of non-dues revenue for your association.
<h3>Courses, Workshops, and Seminars</h3>
Courses, workshops, and seminars are another way of generating non-dues revenue. Not only do they offer your members the chance to improve their industry knowledge, they also give them the opportunity to network.
<blockquote><strong>Top Tip.</strong> Use these educational opportunities as a way to keep your members up-to-date about the latest in the industry. This will add even more value to the educational courses you offer and encourage more members to sign-up.</blockquote>

A growing number of associations are monetizing their data to generate non-dues revenue. They are monetizing their data in the form of market intelligence, benchmarking data, data analytics, and custom research.
<h3>Market Intelligence</h3>
Selling market intelligence is another good source of non-dues revenue for your association. A report by Avenue M Group found that <strong>25%</strong> of associations derive revenue from benchmarking data and <strong>19%</strong> earn revenue from selling market intelligence.
<h3>Data Analytics</h3>
Data analytics can also be used to increase non-dues revenue, either from selling them on or using them to improve your association’s marketing. Data such as Members’ past transactions, demographics, and the benefits and content they consume online can give you clues about what your members are interested in and willing to pay for.
<blockquote><strong>Top Tip.</strong> All associations already have all their member data, but many don’t know how to organize or use it effectively. The best way to get on top of your data is with membership software.

Whether you’re trying to generate non-dues revenue or not, producing a monthly newsletter is a must. So, you’re probably already doing this. But if you have the resources, you may also be able to publish a quarterly or yearly magazine for your association.
<h3>Magazine</h3>
Having an association magazine is an excellent source of non-dues revenue. You can charge companies for advertising space and, on top of this, you can charge non-members a subscription fee. A magazine is also a key marketing tool for your association as it’s another method through which you can promote yourself.
<blockquote><strong>Top Tip.</strong> Although print may be in decline, according to the Association Publishing Survey, <strong>88%</strong> of associations still consider publications an important source of revenue.</blockquote>
<h2 id=""content"">Premium Content</h2>

By posting premium content you can become a go-to source of information for your members. Nowadays, there are many different platforms on which you can post your content and attract new, potential members. However, the platforms that have seen the most popularity in recent years are podcasts and YouTube.
<h3>Podcasts</h3>
In 2018 at least <a href=""https://www.convinceandconvert.com/podcast-research/the-13-critical-podcast-statistics-of-2018/"">112 million Americans were listening to podcasts</a> every month, 11% more than in 2017, with 67 million. Podcasts are an affordable way to drive content and engage members, as well as generate non-dues revenue.
<h3>YouTube Channel</h3>
YouTube is a great platform that you can use to promote yourself, whether you’re posting interviews with leading experts in your field or how-to videos. Moreover, YouTube allows you to produce a live feed with up to 6 cameras, for little to no cost. This means you can do live telecasts at your events.
<blockquote><strong>Top Tip.</strong> Podcasts and YouTube also supply an opportunity to collect new membership leads. End each video or podcast with a way potential members can find out more about your association.</blockquote>
<h2 id=""discount"">Discount and Savings</h2>

Negotiating special discounts and savings for your members is another way to give more value to your members and generate non-dues revenue for your association. Companies you may want to approach for discounts and savings are office supplies and insurance products like professional liability and health. But these are just suggestions, don’t think you have to limit yourself only to these!
<h3>Partnerships</h3>
Creating partnerships with companies to provide discounts for your members is a great source of non-dues revenue for your association. With partnerships, your association can earn fees for referrals, a percentage of sales, or revenue from advertising.
<blockquote><strong>Top Tip.</strong> Partner up with companies that offer products or services that members need in their business or personal lives.</blockquote>

In addition to included membership benefits, you could offer additional association member services for a fee to boost non-dues revenue. These membership perks can be offered à-la-carte or through a tiered membership.
<h3>Tiered Membership</h3>
With a tiered membership system, you could offer packages of different prices that include different benefits. Click here for ideas on what tier membership packages could include.
<h3>À-La-Carte Membership Perks</h3>
With à-la-carte membership perks, certain services might work well as a free membership perk while others could be offered for an additional fee. Moreover, making these perks member-only will act as an extra incentive for potential members to join your association.
<blockquote><strong>Top Tip.</strong> Associations offering tiered memberships or more à-la-carte options tend to attract more millennials interested in association membership.</blockquote>
<h2>Back to You</h2>
Needless to say, you shouldn't implement all of these methods at once! Start small with one or two methods and then build from there. I'd recommend starting with events, sponsorship, and advertising because it's likely that you already host events, so now make the most of them - get sponsors and find companies who want advertising space. With EventBank's Event and Membership Management Software, you can easily plan, manage, and carry out your events. You can also track attendee and member data and in time, start using data analytics to create another source of non-dues revenue for your association.

15466,"Dear Developers, Don’t be Afraid of New Tech: An Open Letter","Dear Developer,

&nbsp;

We see new tech comes out every day, whether it’s a new way to manage your servers, a new programming language or a new framework that claims to improve the quality of your project by a huge leap. By the nature of developers, we are excited, but also sceptical, some of us will give it a try, some will simply keep an eye on it, or forget it’s existence after a month.

The majority won’t even give it a try.

I know what you’re afraid of. We’re all busy, we don’t want to waste time on some mumbo-jumbo. And some new thing will never take off. Hello, Dlang users, how’re you feeling today? Good? How about you, UWP developers? Oh, by the way, how’s your Silverlight project going? Switched to Flash at the end? Good for you and welcome to mobile! Have you chosen to write Xamarin projects for all mobile platforms? It’s good you didn’t choose PhoneGap.

The tech world is always moving forward, and there’s a reason for that, ancient tech is a liability... an expensive liability. Software is never a done deal. It requires constant maintenance. For example when IBM has to fix a bug in S/360, or when Microsoft has to issue a security patch for XP, you can see tears in their team members' faces, and it’s not because of joy.

With processor becoming more powerful every day, and with more and more knowledge shared on the internet, we keep developing a new tech which we hope will liberate us from tedious works. We often take things for granted, but consider all the beautiful animations in your pocket computer, aka, phone, it has been built on layers of abstractions of layers of abstractions, we only need to write application to describe what size of a view we need, which colour it should be and it translates to another layer, then another layer, and at the end, carefully calculated pixel lights up or dims down in a result. Without abstractions, a simple task - like drawing a view - will take months. And these layers got build by constantly moving forward.

The software world is such an amazing world in which you can easily find everything you need and create something entirely new. That’s why we see new things that might be created by a million-dollar company or by a single individual in the most remote corner of the world coming out every day.

Remember, the core of your capacity is to fix a problem, build things, not the syntax of a language, or a method name in a framework.

Yes, the new tech you’re trying might fail someday, but you learned new ‘tricks’ along the way. Your Haskell skill maybe didn’t help you to find a new job. So what? You learned how to do functional programming that you can use in so many fields. Your preferred packaging management tool might have lost the battle with big names, but by comparing them, you know the pros and cons of each one of them, when cons of that big name finally come to haunt you, you know how to pivot.

Microsoft is killing Silverlight. So what? With all the things you have learned about browsers, devices, and graphics, every team will be glad to have you on board. You’re familiar with Docker Swarm, but now you have to move to Kubernets, guess what, the concepts are similar, you can acquire new skills within a day or two. Or maybe you’re an early Swift adopter, and now you need to do server-side application development, you’ll find Rust/Kotlin/Scala/Java somehow familiar.

The world is moving forward, learning new things is a necessity. Being a qualified developer means being a life long learner. It’s hard for some people, but if you’re an early adopter of new tech, or someone who’s willing to try new things, you’ll find your job becoming easier every day, not the other way around.

Best Regards,

15516,"5-Step Guide to Member Journey Mapping for Associations","As an association, you obviously want high levels of recruitment, engagement, and retention, but reaching these goals isn’t always easy. For one, your members’ <strong>needs and expectations are constantly changing and shifting</strong>. Moreover, each of your members has probably joined your association for different reasons and with different goals in mind.

So, how do you tailor each member’s experience so it’s the most rewarding for them? And encourages them to continue renewing their membership? It all boils down to one thing: understanding your members. And the best way to do this? Member journey mapping.

Member journey mapping is an effective way of seeing your members’ experience from their point of view. Member Journey maps are an outline of each step of the member experience. It should start from their first interaction and subsequent engagement all the way through to, hopefully, a lifelong relationship.

The first few months of membership with your organization will leave a lasting impression on your members, be it good or bad. Therefore, it's vital that their first experiences with your association are remembered for the right reasons. Never forget, first impressions matter, and you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.
<h3>Registration</h3>
The first step of member journey mapping is to map out the sign-up process and consider how it could be improved. First, is it easy to find the registration form on your website? Second, is the sign-up process simple and quick to fill out? In this day and age, people are accustomed to being able to do anything and find anything almost instantaneously. If the sign-up process is too time-consuming, potential members may give up on registering.

So, when mapping out the registration process, make sure there are clear links to your registration form and make the form itself as concise as possible, while still collecting all the necessary information.
<h3>Onboarding Process</h3>
Next, you’ll need to map out the onboarding process. Consider, is it clear and concise for each member? And does it present them with information that will help them to settle in and know what to expect?

We’d recommend welcoming a new member with a specially curated onboarding packet. This should include information on how to access the member portal, join a committee, access important documents, and register for an event. Also, if possible, you could ask longtime members to link up with new members. They can share their own experiences as well as answer any questions the new member has.
<h3>First 90 Days</h3>
The first 90 days of membership is a critical period for making a good impression with a new member. So, I can’t stress enough how important it is for you to map out this period. Within these 90 days, your aims are to educate new members about your association, to find out why they joined, and to engage them so they feel like they belong.

When educating your members about your association, you want to make sure they understand the benefits you offer and how to start taking advantage.

Understanding why a new member joined is vital to tailor the experience for them. For example, if a new member joined with the aim of making professional connections, then you’ll want to keep them informed of upcoming networking events.

Finally, once your members are educated about your association and you know why they joined, you’ll know how to engage them.
<h2 id=""Profiling"">Member Profiling</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5421 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/admidio-1024x614.png"" alt=""admidio membership"" width=""1024"" height=""614"" />

Understanding different member profiles ideal to your association is essential when member journey planning. Each member profile likely has different needs and expectations of their membership to your association, so it’s important you fulfill each individual’s requirements of you.
<h3>Member Personas</h3>
Member Personas are semi-fictional representations of your ideal members based on market research and real data about existing members. They represent the goals, challenges, and pain points of different member types. But what is their role in member journey mapping? By understanding when a member will need certain benefits over others, you can better message the value you provide to them. This tangible value will encourage your members to renew their memberships every year.

While there are many ways to profile members, a consistently helpful way to look at them is based on where they are in their careers. For example, a member early in their career might need your association to network and learn more about the industry. Whereas, a member later in their career may need your help to keep up with new trends and best practices.
<h3>Data</h3>
While you definitely want to talk to your members to create your member personas, you also want to pay attention to what your members are actually doing. Based on the events they attend, workshops they sign up for, and committees they join, you can see where different members engage most with your association. This will help you to map a member’s journey as well as construct member personas.
<h2 id=""Paths"">Member Paths</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-123 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/association-millenials-members-1024x683.jpeg"" alt=""How to make millenials become members of your association?"" width=""1024"" height=""683"" />

As you develop member profiles, you should include questions that will help you gain a better understanding of how they found you and how they prefer to interact with you. Using this information to create member paths is an important part of member journey mapping.

Although younger members may be happy to receive all communication digitally, older members may wish to receive information through more traditional channels, such as a renewal notification in the mail. Understanding these different preferences is an opportunity to ensure the best conversion rate on both new member sign-ups and renewals.

Below are two sample paths. In each case, a known group is being targeted with the information most relevant to them in the medium they are most likely to consume it.
<h3>New Young Member</h3>
Initially becomes interested in your association because of an article posted on social media. They then come to your website to learn more about your association, which encourages them to sign-up via the online registration form. After signing up, they are emailed a package outlining all the <b>relevant </b>benefits they can now access and how. They follow the tracked links in the email to find out more.
<h3>Existing Older Member</h3>
When the time for renewal comes around, they receive a renewal notice in the mail, with a self-addressed stamped envelope. The renewal notice comes as part of a renewal package that mentions upcoming events, recent industry data, and other information <b>relevant </b>to the profile of an older member.
<h2 id=""Nurture"">Member Nurture</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3035 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/email-3249062_1280-1024x573.png"" alt=""association management software automation"" width=""1024"" height=""573"" />

Once you have acquired new members, you now wanted to focus on retention and renewals. Renewals are the lifeblood of any organization because they provide an ongoing revenue stream. Moreover, the renewal rate is also a useful indicator of how satisfied your members are with your association. Therefore, an essential part of member journey mapping is the journey your existing members are experiencing.
<h3>Contact</h3>
Planning your communications with members, both new and old, is vital. Every contact between your association and your members should meet, if not exceed, their expectations. Moreover, these communications should adapt as your members' expectations and needs change. Every letter or email you send should possess information that is valuable to that individual member.
<h3>Engagement</h3>
Engagement with your longstanding members is an important part of member journey mapping. It is far easier to engage with and map the journeys of your longstanding members. Not only do you know their member persona and member path, you have also had time to collect their personal data. You now know what events they like to attend, what workshops they sign-up for, and the committees they have joined. Moreover, you can see their engagement over time, its peaks and troughs, and therefore understand what encourages their renewals and engagement. So, use this information to create a unique experience and journey that will keep them renewing.
<h2 id=""Personalization"">Member Personalization</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-11228 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/personalised-mail.jpg"" alt=""letter with personal information"" width=""474"" height=""356"" />

In a study by Accenture, <a href=""https://www.adagetechnologies.com/3-digital-strategies-grow-engage-associations-membership/"">56% of consumers</a> admitted to being more inclined to patronize a retailer if it offered a personalized experience. The same logic applies to association memberships. Personalization allows you to offer each of your members a unique and tailor-made experience that will encourage them to renew.

Member personalization is more exact than member profiling: instead of grouping similar members under one persona, personalization focuses on each individual member. However, due to this, it requires the collection of data from each individual, and is, therefore, more suited to longstanding members of your association.
<h3>Surveys</h3>
One of the best ways to collect data about your members is through the use of surveys. You can choose to do a simple free online survey, or you can get more detailed with a Personalized URL (PURL) campaign. The advantage of a PURL campaign is that you can personalize the questions based on the member’s answers.

Surveys are a good way of collecting data from new members as well as longstanding members. I’d recommend asking new members to fill out a survey 90 days into their membership to learn more about them individually and collect their data so as to start personalizing their experience.
<h3>Data</h3>
Collected member data is another key source to aid in personalization. Knowing where they engage the most with your association can help you to personalize their membership experience. With the use of data capture, you can send out personalized content relevant to them. This could include recommended courses, events, and job opportunities.

On top of this when communicating with members, instead of sending out mass communications, add a personal feel. This could be as simple as adding members' names to messages or sending out a birthday message.
<h2>Back to you</h2>
Now, you may be thinking that all of your members are so different, it’s impossible to create one journey map for them all, and I completely agree. So, you’ll probably want to create several member journey maps that represent your different member personas. Not all members are the same, and you want your member journey map to be as accurate as possible.

Our final piece of advice is to always keep in mind why you are member journey mapping: it’s all about engaging your members at the right time through the right medium so that they want to renew.

15638,"Success Story: How WorkTech is Teaming Up with EventBank","This success story is a result of feedback received from <strong><a href=""https://worktechasia.com/"">WorkTech</a></strong>, where a solution was needed to help segment their tenants, manage contacts, and expand their data and analytics expertise while they expand their office spaces around Asia.
<h2>Challenges</h2>
The primary focus for adding on a digital platform into WorkTech’s internal segmentation of their tenants as well as their contact database. Segmentation of tenants at WorkTech would give the ability to target their tenants for promotional campaigns, events, and so on. This is particularly important for WorkTech as co-working spaces in other countries as they operate on different websites, so often times, CRMs and Analytics tools are operating separately at a time in WorkTech’s expansion requires a global communication push that includes segmenting audiences as said before.

Among this challenge, WorkTech is expanding to new locations including Taiwan &amp; Singapore with more to come soon. This means that a solution provided to help segment and target customers, needs to be scalable to the company’s growth, all while being accessible easily and on-the-go.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15744 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WorkTech-299QRC-01.jpg"" alt=""worktech asia office"" width=""1200"" height=""825"" />
<h2>App Consolidation</h2>
Consolidating tools into one platform does not mean downsizing capabilities to meet accessibility. WorkTech has recognized this important aspect of selecting future software partners that they intend to use for their global expansion strategy. Consolidation of tools into one app is a must have, as it’s more scalable, cost effective, and reliable to have a single team using a single tool to do multiple jobs. Thusly, it makes communication and engagement with tenants more reliably consistent, both enforcing their brand, and collecting data into one place, rather than separated on a multitude of tools.

By using EventBank’s all-in-one software, majority of necessary modules like CRM, Email Campaigns, and Events for instance, are not only all together on one tool, but they also work together. Content and data from the CRM, feed into the Email campaigns for easier promotion, and the actions taken by the tenants both on the email like a click or reply, as well as at events like registrations, feed back into the CRM in order to automatically update the contact. With a tool like this, expansion requires nothing to do on EventBank. The lists grow, the content is fed with updates from tenants, and vice versa. Making it truly a scalable platform for their needs. Colleagues from different offices can all log in to EventBank and use it for local events and contact engagement, or, it can be run by a single team and have communication that impacts a wide range of locations.
<h2>The Results</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15742 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/7f16ee3f-5c68-4dc0-a2bc-69a37ed5c85e.jpg"" alt=""worktech asia"" width=""1440"" height=""809"" />

The move to EventBank was smooth, as the platform is hosted on the cloud, the desktop-browser version and the management app can be used to log in and get directly to the all-in-one tool immediately. This means that WorkTech can now use EventBank to create events, member management (tenants, in their case) and promote news and materials all from a scalable platform that can grow along side WorkTech. For managers and planners at WorkTech, this means they can create event pages and promotional emails in multiple regions of Asia, without having to switch tools or accounts.

This also gives the opportunity for WorkTech to collect tenant's data, and capture their engagements like what events they have attended, when they registered, and any and all demographics. This main CRM module is updated based on actions taken by staff, like manual profile updates, but also automatically captures data from the tenant as they engage back to WorkTech.

This new consolidated and up-to-date CRM can then be used to create email lists that are segmented and targeted to specific types of tenants, their level of engagement, and more. This data can also be analyzed in the EventBank platform to draw conclusions and capture trends among the tenants, making it easier for WorkTech to take action on certain aspects of their operations that would have otherwise been impossible had they been using tools that are separate.

15663,"How to Market Your Events in the Philippines: What Data Doesn't Say","<b>81%</b> of people in the Philippines use social media to send messages every day.

<b>64%</b> of internet users in the Philippines say that what they read on social media influences their purchasing habits.

At EventBank we’ve been engaging with events in the Philippines for years, and we’ve collected some great tips and tricks for marketing your event in the Philippines by speaking with the local professionals themselves.

We have the data, but they have the insights. Let’s take a look at what the data wants you to believe, and see if the local professionals agree or have something different to say.

We retrieved feedback from local professionals in the Philippines from our<strong><a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/define-event-engagement-panel/""> past event here</a></strong>.
<h2>1. Social Media</h2>
<h3>What the Data Says</h3>
Social media is by far and large one of the biggest centers of communication and brand affinity in the Philippines, and the probability of having your posts shared is very high, as the Philippines boasts some of the highest social media engagement rates in the world. So, which platform should you be using?
<div id=""all-social_media-PH-monthly-201809-201909"" style=""width: 750px; height: 400px;""></div>
<!-- You may change the values of width and height above to resize the chart --><a href=""https://gs.statcounter.com/social-media-stats/all/philippines""><script type=""text/javascript"" src=""https://www.statcounter.com/js/fusioncharts.js""></script><script type=""text/javascript"" src=""https://gs.statcounter.com/chart.php?all-social_media-PH-monthly-201809-201909&chartWidth=600""></script></a>

In the Philippines, there’s a large gap in generational demographics between social media platforms. For instance, you won’t impact many Gen Z age ranges in Facebook compared to choosing to engage them on other platforms like Tiktok and Instagram. If your target audience is likely in older generations, 30+ years old, Facebook and Email are still the go-to methods of promotion.

<b>Here’s some highlights:</b>
<ul>
 	<li>Facebook is increasing in popularity with 19% increase in Philippines user-base.</li>
 	<li>Youtube is decreasing in popularity in the Philippines in the last 12 months.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What the Experts Say</h3>
In EventBank’s panel discussion event, ‘How do you define event engagement?’ in Manila, Philippines to help other event professionals discuss their challenges and strategies in event marketing in the Philippines. Let’s hear from local Filipino events professionals what they have to say about marketing their events in the Philippines.

<img class=""notfull alignleft wp-image-15676 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/RJLedesma-BIO-PIC.png"" alt="""" width=""510"" height=""115"" />
<blockquote><strong><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">""</span></strong>The success of ROI is first based on budgets, and second, based on objectives. Channels used include Facebook for sure, but is really just targeting the 30+-year-old range as younger Gen Z and Y audiences have flocked to Tiktok, Instagram and Snapchat. Younger generations don't use Facebook as much, as they tend to stick to using Facebook messenger, which has lead to agencies turning to chatbots instead. Instagram can be used for cross-market for a more mature millennial audience.<strong><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">""</span></strong></blockquote>
&nbsp;
<h3>The Big Takeaway</h3>
Because data can sometimes never tell the difference between Facebook's main platform and it's Messenger service, it can be difficult to catch trends like usage of Messenger by younger audiences, versus say an older user that's 30+ years old using the main Facebook platform. This leaves opportunities for engagement via Chatbots or other promotional materials meant for a text messaging experience. When it comes to content that sensitive to age ranges or generational gaps, make sure you target your messaging according the platform it's being shared on. It might even be fruitful to leverage entirely different platforms for a target audience due to their content consumption habits.
<h2>2. Go Mobile-First</h2>
<h3>What the Data Says</h3>
What device your organization uses to be it's main focus of marketing efforts is extremely important, as this can often times dictate what type of content you create, it's format, and even the channels you use to advertise or organically grow on.

So for the Philippines which device is used the most?

<b>Here’s a highlight:</b>
<ul>
 	<li>Mobile users are expected to surpass desktop users by 2020 in the Philippines.</li>
 	<li>Data bandwidth for mobile is surpassing local wifi routers and hotspots, leaving more users to abandon their PCs for content consumption.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What the Experts Say</h3>
&nbsp;

<img class=""notfull alignleft wp-image-15758 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Gigi-Bio.png"" alt=""gigi bautistis events marketing gba"" width=""510"" height=""115"" />
<blockquote><strong><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">""</span></strong><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">When on-site, it’s important to have an Event App, not just to help go paperless, but it’s a seamless way to both capture and engages attendees. In China, where WeChat is everything. All contact, sign in, and engagement is now done on WeChat, so the need to market both before, after and during is now the most important strategy in the modern era of events.</span><strong><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">""</span></strong></blockquote>
&nbsp;
<h3>The Big Takeaway</h3>
To make sure you're engaging your audience to the best of your abilities, it extends well beyond marketing that brings them in, but also the marketing that keeps them engaged, and even past the event. What device the attendee uses ends up being key for this methodology, as it can be used as the medium for discovery, then used as the check in device, and then back to being a marketing medium for post-marketing outreach. Furthermore, it's important to note that this does dictate how your event's web presence looks and behaves. If your event page is not mobile-ready, then neither will be your event. Make sure that your digital tool or web developer is well aware to create your event page, including all forms and ticketing, with mobile in mind.
<h2>3. Leverage Video Content</h2>
<h3>What the Data Says</h3>
While Youtube as a social media platform is losing traction throughout 2019 in the Philippines, Video remains one of the highest conversion areas of marketing in the Philippines at <strong>6.05%</strong>. So, where did all the video views go?

In all likelyhood, video content is shifting little by little from Youtube to Social Media feeds like Facebook and Twitter in the Philippines, and so when promoting your event, you should leverage video content in your sharing campaigns, or even spend money on them to boost the posts to a target audience on ad networks.

<blockquote><strong>""</strong>Video content is highly engaging, and bandwidth around the world is getting faster and more readily available, so much so that video can be the main source of engagement before and after events.<strong>""</strong></blockquote>
<h3>The Big Takeaway</h3>
When it comes to Video content, it's one of the most engaging methods of digital marketing for events in the philippines. The data shows it, and the experts agree. But, the missing link that the data doesn't say, and what Stephen does say, that may have gone over your head: ""...before and <strong>after events</strong>"". When it comes to event ROI, engagement takes a nosedive a few days after an event. There's rarely hard evidence the event took place and it can easily slip the mind of even the most engaged attendees and speakers.

So make sure you're using just as much efforts in your post-event engagement as you are in your pre-event engagement. That means leveraging video on social as Stephen says, but also not forgetting proper email followups and social posts on other platforms.

15701,"World Laureates Forum: Hurdling the Industry's Toughest Challenges with EventBank","<span class=""font-size-large"">The <strong>World Laureates Forum</strong>, which seeks to open discussion, recognize, and award individuals for their progress towards society, held their 2nd annual laureate's forum in Shanghai (China) using EventBank as its event management software. This year's topic focused on Science and Technology for the Betterment of Mankind, and played host to a number of Nobel Prize recipients speaking about their experiences and ideas for the future. </span>

<span class=""font-size-large"">This marks a special milestone in EventBank's strive for delivering professional event hosting and management. As a technology partner for an event with such high-level speakers and attendees, it was not just important for us to provide complete transparency with local authorities, but above all, to ensure absolutely seamless event experience from the first event invitation through online registrations to check-ins to the esteemed Nobel laureates who have provided so much to humanity.</span>

[caption id=""attachment_15704"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1083""]<img class=""wp-image-15704 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Speaker-Panel-Laureates.png"" alt=""event management software for China, WLF Shanghai running on EventBank"" width=""1083"" height=""541"" /> A selection of the WLF's esteemed speakers, screenshot from the event page created using EventBank's all-in-one event management software with some special features for events organized in China[/caption]
<h2>A High Degree of Professionalism</h2>
At the WLA Forum, guest speakers and attendees consisted of high-ranking officials from the government, Nobel prize recipients, and other high-profile representatives from institutions of high calibre. The degree of human scientific advancement and achievements speaking together under one roof is no small matter, and it was EventBank's privilege to be their event technology partner. In being their partner, EventBank had the responsibility to present the event and the speakers &amp; VIPs with a level of professionalism that these remarkable individuals deserve. And with this in mind, EventBank's platform was ready to take on this challenge.

The EventBank's all-in-one platform helped organizers of World Laureates Forum by automating many tasks like event website creation, event invitations, badge printing and check-ins which had required manual workflows, saving an average of three hours per employee, per week in a month leading to the event. As a result, the team had more time to engage and provide a personalized experience to the attendees as well as to focus on other aspects of the event's operations.

[caption id=""attachment_15703"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""800""]<img class=""wp-image-15703 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/mmexport1572500086540.jpg"" alt=""World Laureates Forum, event badge examples"" width=""800"" height=""355"" /> Example of badges EventBank's platform helped to generate for attendees of World Laureates Forum in Shanghai[/caption]

Now, when it was time for WLF's team to create event invitations, specific attendee information transferred directly from EventBank CRM and the appropriate recipients were automatically added. Information about the event was also automatically added to email campaigns from the integrated <a href=""https://wlaforum.eventbank.cn/event/2019-%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E9%A1%B6%E5%B0%96%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E5%AE%B6%E8%AE%BA%E5%9D%9B-%E9%80%9A%E7%A5%A8%E9%82%80%E7%BA%A6-23985/"">WLF's event page</a>. Using EventBank has eliminated the lengthy time it took to draft email campaigns and minimized the chance for potential human error.

With EventBank, our clients only need a few clicks to send out a professional, branded email campaign. Additionally, utilizing centralized templates integrated with event pages means that every team member is sending out the most current event marketing content.

<h2>Total Transparency</h2>
When it comes to the MICE industry, creating events where there's a large number of high profile or government related topics, are one of the biggest challenges an organizer can face. Requirements are oftentimes demanding, with constant security updates, testing, and investigation even if just one guest represents a high-level position or government that incurs a certain level of security scrutiny. When it comes to EventBank as the World Laureates Forum (<a class=""_ps2id"" href=""http://www.wlaforum.org/"" data-ps2id-offset="""">WLA Forum</a>'s) technology partner, it was important for us to provide complete and total transparency with local and organizer officials. The event itself was hosted by the Shanghai local government in conjunction with the World Laureates Association and held high-government interaction, including the mayor of Shanghai, Ying Yong, and Party Secretary of Shanghai, Li Qiang.

The joint-managed forum sought to add on a digital partner that was willing and able to comply with local authorities on certain hot issues like transparency, data collection privacy, and other technical security facets like software penetration testing proof and web-security standards. After a long process of testing and validation, Eventbank was found to be the <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/event-management-software-china/"">ideal partner</a> in terms of security and transparency for all attending and speaking guests at the forum.",,2019-11-04,post,http://blog.eventbank.com/world-laureates-forum-eventbank/,http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ol-8.jpeg|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/mmexport1572500086540.jpg|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Speaker-Panel-Laureates.png|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/WLA.png|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/eventbank-exploration-patterns-1-copy-22@2x.png|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/eventbank-exploration-patterns-1-copy-22@2x-1.png|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/65385-1.jpg|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/65386-1.jpg|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/65387-1.jpg|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bl-1.jpg|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bl-5.jpeg|http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MicrosoftTeams-image-90.jpg,"ol (8)|mmexport1572500086540|Speaker Panel Laureates|WLA|eventbank-exploration-patterns-1 copy 22@2x|eventbank-exploration-patterns-1 copy 22@2x|65385 (1)|65386 (1)|65387 (1)|bl (1)|bl (5)|MicrosoftTeams-image (90)",|||||||||||,|||||||||||,"|world laureates forum event badge examples||||||WLA Forum||WLA Check in||",http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ol-8.jpeg,,"Case Study|Success Stories","event management software|events|organizing events",English,,publish,25,robert,robert.rafferty@eventbank.com,Robert,Rafferty,world-laureates-forum-eventbank,,,0,0,0,open,open,2019-11-04
15774,"Success Story: How Tempe Chamber is Keeping Members Engaged with EventBank","This success story is a result of feedback received from the Tempe Chamber of Commerce in Tempe, Arizona where a solution was needed to help streamline event management, membership communication, and general digital chamber management. The responses are a result of success with EventBank tackling Tempe Chamber’s challenges by using a plethora of tools, professional templates, and smarter member management.
<h2>From Clunky to Funky</h2>
Tempe Chamber for a long period of time had relied on other chamber management platforms before being introduced to EventBank, and so is a new type of success story that EventBank has the pleasure of delivering to you. While their past chamber management software solution was viable as a chamber solution goes, it was lacking in UI, tools, and overall felt clunky to the client, leaving some gaps in communication or overall became a time-sink.

Some of Tempe Chamber’s issues before adoption of the EventBank platform included:
<ul>
 	<li>Poor user experience</li>
 	<li>Integration headaches</li>
 	<li>Elongated event management steps</li>
 	<li>Lack of necessary tools</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Results</h2>
Tempe Chamber was introduced to EventBank via news of our scholarship program, and soon took on the product as a solution not to its chamber management, but to replace an oftentimes clunky software they were using at the time. With EventBank perfectly integrating not just with their current tools, but also natively integrated with the internal tools of the platform.

EventBank takes these necessary tools and combines them into an easy-to-use platform where all the modules and features are integrated internally, and operate off of one, and only one database. Leading to a healthier contact list that is updated frequently without splitting up contact lists across different tools.

These tools include: CRM, Event Page Builder, Email Campaigns, Payment processing, Mobile Membership management, and much more. While other solutions may include these tools, the value EventBank brought to the table for Tempe Chamber’s challenges was that each tool shares information and data between them, and it automatically updated based on actions taken by the chamber, or by members &amp; attendees. This also allows the chamber to communicate effectively with members using email campaigns, through notifications on the website or mobile app and even automatically reminding members that their membership is almost expiring.

In response to using EventBank, Tempe Chamber has only praise for its user-friendliness, and ability to harmonize their communication into one place, saving time, energy, and headaches for the chamber, no matter how big or complex the event or promotion campaign may be.

15781,"7 Secrets to Membership Acquisition for Hong Kong Chambers & Associations","EventBank held an event in November 2019 that collected some of Hong Kong's top professionals in the chambers and associations space. It was a round table event where discussions took place between professionals in charge of membership acquisition to share and learn from each other's experiences.

Throughout this event, we've uncovered some secrets to membership acquisition in Hong Kong that could be useful for your organization. Organizations that joined the discussion included the CFA Institute of Hong Kong, Canadian &amp; Irish Chambers of Commerce, and other membership-based organizations from around Hong Kong.

Let's dig in.

<h2 id=""professionals"">Welcome Young Professionals</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15790 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MicrosoftTeams-image-91.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1920"" height=""880"" />

The number one issue that plagues associations and chambers in Hong Kong is that young professionals oftentimes have a perception of these organizations as being old fashioned and just ""not for them"".

This perception has been a major pain point as many professionals under the age of 40 are seeing themselves as not experienced enough to be a part of associations in their industry or chambers related to their country of origin.

In reality, chambers and associations are looking for young professionals to bring new skill sets and perspectives into their events, committees, networking, and other aspects of their organizations because it breathes new life, and adds new headcount which leads to much better ROI.

Furthermore, this benefits young professionals to join these organizations because at such a young start in their career, they would actually benefit more from the networking, rather than later on where their experience is already at a zenith.
<h2 id=""responsibility&quot;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Everyone</span> is responsible for membership</h2>
<img class=""alignnone wp-image-15791 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MicrosoftTeams-image-92.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1920"" height=""880"" />

A major takeaway from our event was the idea that everyone at an organization is responsible for membership acquisition. Even the members themselves.

There should never be one person or one team's responsibility to acquire new members at any organization, it should, in fact, be the responsibility of everyone at the organization. The ability to expand your membership based on referrals is oftentimes understated, and without incentive, it can oftentimes hold back membership growth potential.

Chambers in Hong Kong also said that this responsibility is also in the hands of members themselves.

With referral incentives and rewards, members can benefit from introducing new members by word of mouth to the chamber, and in doing so, leaves a lot of the labor of membership acquisition out of the hands of the internal staff, freeing up more time to allow the chamber to provide overall standard chamber benefits to members as a whole.
<h2 id=""value"">Members stay for value, not for loyalty</h2>
<img class=""alignnone wp-image-15793 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MicrosoftTeams-image-94.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1920"" height=""880"" />

When it comes to running a membership-based organization, a consensus was reached at our event, that there is no such thing as a loyal member. We can oftentimes mistake loyalty for what is in reality, a member who just sees value in their membership.

Members are not loyal, they are simply staying for the value you provide. Therefore, when it comes to membership acquisition, your angle to approach should not be that of loyalty, but that of value. To this end, some feedback was gathered that running loyalty programs can oftentimes harm your member's perception of value.

Because if they're just staying for the loyalty rewards, then what is the purpose of being a member?

What can an organization do to keep members happy, and feel value in that organization, long before any gimmicky strategies like rewards are needed to be used to retain members?

A solution mentioned at our event included running events that are paid or for members only. The idea that an event has exclusivity gives a lot of value to members, and organizations that run only public events can lose members since members can just join events without having to pay to be a member in the first place

<script async src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script>
A minor, but also underutilized secret to membership growth, is the usage of social media to impact your ever increasingly social media-driven audience. Chambers of commerce and industry associations as we've said before often times have the perception of being old school and antiquated.

Jumping on social media like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook can help bring down barriers to your communication to audiences who might be a fit for your organization. Posting images, recording videos, or communicating your value can lift the curtain off your organization and give more insight to audiences as to what you do and how you could impact them.

Social media also provides a valuable resource to organizations as it gives a platform to join in on related community discussions, and most importantly, social media is not just for posting, but for social listening. Listening to conversations can give a lot of insights into your area of expertise or communities, and give you a head start to catch trends and implement those trends as topics for your chamber or association to capitalize on for your members or to add on new members.
<h2 id=""skills"">If you offer courses, sell soft skills too</h2>
While more suited for associations than chambers, offering courses and classes is a common practice that members will seek to further career aspirations, expand their skill sets, or obtain certifications. While these are indeed a driving goal for organizations that run these types of learning activities, it can be overwhelming as you can assume most members are already working, and after they're out of the office, overwhelming hard-skills courses can easily turn them off.

A solution suggested by the CFA Institute HK says that if you're looking to keep members attending courses that are geared toward hard skills, then it's actually best to pair it up with soft skills as well. Not only are these skills lacking in the labor-force as of lately in Hong Kong, but it's something that young professionals are actively looking for as a career aspiration. In fact, it can oftentimes become a course of its own. The less-intense coursework still gives a feeling of accomplishment, while not exhausting working-class members.
<h2 id=""advertising"">No one is budgeting for paid advertising</h2>
A major gap for opportunity in membership acquisition in Hong Kong is the lack of local digital and physical paid advertising. Often times chambers are a culprit of this, but associations too can benefit from the huge lack in paid advertising.

Most membership-based organizations run events, sponsor events, or exhibit at events, and this can sometimes fool management or staff that they're just enacted a marketing activity, but in reality, it's only a small part of the potential marketing activities a chamber or association could be engaging in.

One of the main areas of membership acquisition campaigning is the usage of paid advertising, especially on digital platforms. When it comes to actively advertising, there is a lot of potential to leverage social media like LinkedIn and Facebook to get your message or offer int the eyes of social media browsers who match your target audience. Or, engaging in search ads in Google that target keywords related to your chamber or association, and even targeting competitors with ads as well.
<h2 id=""passport"">Chamber &amp; Chapter Global Passport</h2>
<img class=""alignnone wp-image-15792 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MicrosoftTeams-image-93.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1920"" height=""880"" />

A more chamber-oriented secret, but useful for associations with clubs or chapters around the globe, is the negotiation of a ""Global Passport"" for members. Meaning, if a member of an Amcham in China visits a country with another aptly named Amcham, that member from Amcham in Country A can now attend events run by AmCham in Country B.

For those not ""in the know"" most chambers of commerce abroad are separate organizations and are not affiliated with each other despite their naming similarities.

A chamber or association ""global passport"" is a new idea that's been experimented before, but is likely more viable now as chambers are getting increasingly more digital and are able to manage digital memberships that support cross-border check-in, registration, and so on.

There is also the reverse idea of this. A ""global passport"" might be able to be used within only one country, but strategic partnerships could lead to a ""passport"" being used by an AmCham member who can now attend BritCham events as if they were a BritCham member, but possibly with limited use per month.
<h2>More to come</h2>

15808,"20 Event Feedback Questions to Enhance Your Next Event","How do you measure your event’s success?

The answer commonly lies in event feedback. Event feedback gives you not one but two benefits as an event organizer: an indication as to how well your recent event fared among its attendees and valuable information for the future to help make your events even better.

It may seem simple, and it can be but what distinguishes good feedback from bad or no feedback at all is really the types of questions you choose to include in your post-event survey. The questions you put in your survey can directly influence the number of responses you get.

 	<li>On a scale of 1 to 10, do you feel the event gave value for money?</li>
</ol>
General questions are always a good idea when conducting a post-event survey. They help you gain an overall understanding of how the event went and give you key points to help you measure its success.

<ol start=""9"">
 	<li>Out of the presentation(s) you attended today, which topic was the most interesting to you?
<ol style=""list-style-type: lower-alpha;"">
 	<li>What about this topic made it particularly interesting?</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Would you want to hear more about any of these topics in future events?

<ol style=""list-style-type: lower-alpha;"">
 	<li>If yes, please elaborate</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
Information fuels events. Whether it be for a conference, webinar, or any other event, asking about your attendees' experience with the topics presented and with the presenters/speakers could really make a difference. It not only lets you know which topics are currently in high demand but also gives you an idea as to the types of presenters/speakers that should be a part of your event next year.
<h2 id=""venue"">Venue and Food
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15729 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/65385-1.jpg"" alt=""venue and food photo event feedback"" width=""1200"" height=""800"" /></h2>

 	<li>If the venue was not accessible to you, please describe how this could be made better.</li>

</li>
 	<li>What features do you think are most important when choosing a venue for future events? (Please list 3).</li>
 	<li>How would you rate the quality of the food?</li>
 	<li>Do you have any suggestions for food that could be provided next time?</li>
</ol>
A major aspect of any event is your choice of venue and food. Venues set the tone for the entire event. A space that is too small or not accessible to your attendees will mean less willingness from them to attend future events so it is important to choose your venue wisely. Food also plays an important in your event. Food helps keep your attendees happy and engaged so providing attendees with a selection of food could be very beneficial to the overall success of your event.
<h2 id=""suggestions"">Audience Suggestions

</ol>
Of course any event feedback survey could not be complete without asking about how an event can be improved for the future. These questions, in particular, are essential since they help highlight the main areas for growth.

While this is a comprehensive list of questions that can be applied to almost any post-event survey, it is important to keep in mind that time is valuable. In order to maximize the response rate and get meaningful feedback from your event, it is important to keep your survey brief and customized to your particular interests for collecting information. Therefore, next time you find yourself thinking about how many questions to include in your survey make sure you first consider how applicable those questions are to your specific event and to your future event decision-making. If it will not tell you anything valuable for future events, it would be best not to include it.

Now that you have a set of questions to choose from, it is time to address how and when these questions should be used. The following is a list of recommendations to help boost your responses and keep your attendees coming back.
<ul>
 	<li>Be mindful of your attendees' time and keep your survey short. Make sure to limit the use of any unnecessary jargon in order to facilitate the survey-taking process and send out your survey within 24 hours of your event. Past 24 hours could mean a lower response rate and less accurate information.</li>
 	<li>A thank you can go a long way. After an event, it is crucial that you thank your attendees for coming. This helps you continue to foster connection building and keeps your event at the top of your attendees' minds.</li>
 	<li>Incentives are a great way to boost your survey response rate. By offering to give out a gift card or special discounts at your next event, attendees will feel more motivated to take and complete your post-event survey.</li>
 	<li>Sometimes all it takes is a reminder. Reminder emails are a great way to keep your event fresh in the minds of your attendees. They also help encourage attendees to complete the survey, but be careful not to send too many reminder emails, one or two should be sufficient.</li>
 	<li>Given that attendees have already gone to one of your events, it is never too early to begin promoting your next event. The ending thank you page of your survey is a great place to feature your upcoming events in order to keep your attendees in the know and grow the number in attendance for the next event.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Now take it from here</h2>
These tips are only a few of many that can help your event feedback survey be a giant success. Keeping in mind that questions should be personalized in order to get the most out of your event feedback, you can use these questions as a prime starting point. These tips will also guide you to make the best decisions for your overall rolling out and survey making strategies in order to increase your survey response rate.

Using these tips and recommended list of questions together, you will be able to not only get feedback but get the right kind of feedback which will help your future events be even better. You are now well equipped to tackle your next post-event survey with confidence.

15847,"3 Challenges, 1 Solution: How India’s Associations Can Double Membership Growth","From 2018 to 2019, the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry (FKCCI) <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/fkcci-success-story/""><b>doubled their</b> <b>membership growth </b></a>by leveraging only one software solution<b>.</b>

There are many software solutions that are able to help support associations in their membership growth goals, but EventBank is one of the few on the ground taking note of client success in India. So, we’ll be talking about membership growth based on user adoption of our software, plus our recent interviews with association professionals at the India Association Congress 2019.

First, let’s take a look at the current state of affairs for associations in India with some feedback we received from the IAC 2019 event which collected some of the biggest leaders in associations in India to share their ideas, challenges, and successes.
<h2>Freeware &amp; Partnerships Addiction</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15849 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MicrosoftTeams-image-15.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1440"" height=""1080"" />

In India, it’s common place that associations, and to an extent chambers of commerce, to adopt singular free-use software solutions, or, to add in partners to help bolster their events, fundraising, or membership growth activities. Riding the fine-line between ROI and Value delivered to an organization’s stakeholders, it can be easy to opt for either freeware software like EventBrite to host events, or otherwise hire partners who can relatively guarantee results.

Also another factor observed is Associations have a fear to adopt and maintain a software by themselves but yet for every big conferences they hire a third party to manage their event. Eventually they don't realize that how much cost could be reduced by having a software of their own.

There are, however, other solutions that can be leveraged that are more long term oriented, and allow for complete control to rest in the hands of the associations that could be benefiting from this engagement control being wrestled back to them.
<h2>Substandard Software that Meets Consumer Tech</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-628 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Check-Ins.jpg"" alt=""Event Registration Tips"" width=""984"" height=""406"" />

As memberships increase, and associations throw events meant to engage the public at large, it can be difficult to find ways to make the process experiential. In India, smartphone adoption as daily use devices will reach 428 Million units sold by 2022, making India become the second largest smartphone market behind China.

With this in mind, an opportunity for associations to grow is rising. Developing countries are often times looking to app development to increase convenience and quality of life by utilizing smartphones as engagement touch points for things like transportation and food delivery functions, or to use as a mobile wallet for areas where banking can be seen as a hassle and India is no exception. Already Indian startups are reaching rapid growth due to app development, and associations could be benefiting from this too.

However, with current tech usage at event spaces, rarely are smartphone being leverage for check in processes, and even fewer are being used to help manage the membership process. With this in mind, having a mobile first event or association site, QR code scan check ins, and mobile membership management can provide the bridge between association and member/attendee who are seeking new ways to engage.
<h2>Lifetime Memberships are Hurting Associations</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5466 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-2.png"" alt=""Virtual Membership Cards"" width=""600"" height=""600"" />

<a href=""https://news.linkedin.com/2019/January/57--indian-professionals-would-consider-switching-careers-to-get"">57% Indian professionals would consider switching careers to get closer to their dream job.</a>

That means it’s more important than ever to deliver value to members and ensure that you’re keeping up with ROI through membership dues as long as possible. This, however, does not mean you should give away lifetime memberships to new members in order to retain member count, a common problem among Indian associations and chambers of commerce.

If professionals are likely to change careers, then it’s not pertinent to offer lifetime solutions to them if they should leave in the future.Associations and Chambers alike are often times struggling with keeping members renewing, and it can be seen as an easy way out to simply deliver lifetime memberships since it can’t be revoked and the number of members can only grow.

This is not the exact strategy that begets ROI, which, is always the prime goal of any organization. An association is only as big as it’s budget allows it to grow, and if your budget is not growing, neither will your association.

The other half of the puzzle is cost. Managing members, hosting events for them, or any other activity are all cost centers for associations. If you are providing lifetime memberships, then your growth is limited to the number of prospective members in your audience. While it can be fruitful in the beginning for potential members to join for the prospect of lifetime membership, costs will inevitably increase to manage the new surge in members, and will quickly out-pace the ROI generated from adding on new lifetime members.

Another aspect taken into account is the length of an average lifetime membership. A lifetime can mean nearly 40-50 years of memberships. Every engagement point like an event for instance that a member attends at this length of time, has a cost to manage that member. This adds up over time as well, and, with a standard 3.43% inflation rate in India, it is very likely that by the end of a member’s lifetime with your association, it would have actually cost you more than the initial membership fee that they had paid.
<h2>Association Management Software as a Solution</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15836 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/eventbank-exploration-patterns-1-copy-45@2x.png"" alt="""" width=""2400"" height=""1288"" />

The above challenges are things that can be tackled with one simple solution, Association Management Software.

Simply dissected, an Association Management Software is often a cloud based software that combines all the necessary tools needed into one platform. Tools like:
<ul>
 	<li>CRMs</li>
 	<li>Membership Managers</li>
 	<li>Email Marketing Tools</li>
 	<li>Web &amp; Event Page Builders</li>
 	<li>Ticketing &amp; Registrations</li>
 	<li>More</li>
</ul>
Solutions like these can make it easier to manage memberships as the tools can be easily accessed anywhere on with an internet connection and share among team members so you can delegate tasks.

It can often times replace the tired hassle of finding and recreating content for events on platforms where it can be a one-time solution and once it’s over with, it’s gone for good, and then the content needs to be recycled in a more manual manager. Among this, branding value is lost with certainty as freeware tools will often prefer their brand to be 50% as visible as yours is <i>at a minimum</i>. As well, what it comes to hiring third party partners to impact events or membership growth, it can often times be pricey, and you’ll find decisions are taken out of your hands.

Both of these solutions are commonplace in India’s Association scene, and it’s often due to the lack of realization that there is an alternative, which is leveraging tools that get your association making smarter decisions and managing better and faster.

EventBank is exactly like this type of solution, but with a little more intricacies under the hood like data sharing between each tool, automated renewal reminders, and virtual membership cards to boot.

Through platforms like ours, it’s more of a long term growth strategy that focuses on the contact CRM and to this, extending to the membership management module as well. Every engagement an association or a contact makes with each other is recorded and updates their profile automatically. That means you can track when a group of contacts have their memberships renewals dates coming up in the next month, or track to see what or how many events any given contact or group of contacts have been a part of and as well update that information as the contacts check in to events or renew/don’t renew their memberships.

The FKCCI and the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce Karnakata are both two examples of success stories in India where EventBank made an impact in their membership growth, or otherwise eased the pain of managing members with what was previously entirely manual processes.

15903,"9 Strategies to Finding Great Speakers for Your Events","Are you having trouble finding speakers for your events? Audiences want someone that is credible and trustworthy to relay them the information. Finding these types of speakers can be a daunting task with the amount of information out there. Speakers can be representative of your event and association and can be the most vital part of your event. These are some tips on how to find some great speakers for your next event.
<h2>1. Dive into social media</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15571 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/value-copy-30@2x.png"" alt=""social media event branding"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

In this digital age, it’s not smart to forget about social media. Social media isn’t only for teenagers to post pictures with their friends. It’s also a tool for your association that can help you find and potentially hire speakers.

Social media can help you find speakers and decide whether their speaking style suits your event. If you have a speaker in mind, you may be able to find videos of prior speeches on YouTube. You can also check out <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/TEDxTalks"">TED Talk </a>videos on YouTube and discover new speakers through this method. Other social media like<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/""> LinkedIn</a> can also help in the search, providing information on their prior experience and work history. These resources can provide insight into a speaker’s expertise in a topic and into their performance.

Once you find a speaker you’re interested in, you can follow up with a more thorough search on the internet. Check out their other platforms and reviews to see if they’re reliable and really up to par.
<h2>2. Use speaker<b> </b>websites</h2>
There are organizations that specialize in training professional speakers and connecting you with those who specialize in public speaking. Websites such as <a href=""http://www.nsaspeaker.org/"">National Speakers Association</a>, <a href=""https://speakerhub.com/speakers"">SpeakerHub</a>, and <a href=""http://buzzsumo.com/"">BuzzSumo</a> are all great resources for booking a speaker for your event. Users can search for a specific topic and will be provided with potential speakers along with their past work. There you can also see past events they have participated in and what they specialize in.
<h2>3. Pay attention to networking and referrals</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15836 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/eventbank-exploration-patterns-1-copy-45@2x.png"" alt=""event feedback "" width=""2400"" height=""1288"" />

It can be easy to put real-life connections on the back-burner with the appeal of the internet and its plethora of resources right at your fingertips. Although online resources can be very helpful in your search for an event speaker, don’t forget about doing it the old fashioned way. Reach out to your network.

If you’re having trouble finding a speaker, don’t ignore the connections you’ve already made! These connections can serve as an invaluable resource when planning your next event. Also, don’t be afraid to ask friends and colleagues for recommendations. You never know where you’ll find your next speaker.

You can also cross-reference network recommendations with your own research. It doesn’t hurt to double-check their experience and credentials with an online search. This being said, you can combine the strategies on this list to ensure you’ve found the best speaker possible. Remember that whoever you choose as a speaker can be representative of your association as a whole. Don’t be afraid to do your research!
<h2>4. See how they interact with their audience</h2>
What is your event about? Who is your audience? Some audiences may react better to speakers who engage with the crowd while others may not. Some speakers may also not choose to stay after their speech to talk to the audience. These factors can influence how you may want the speaker to interact with your audience. The best speakers will have real life examples of failures and successes that the audience will be able to relate to. You can gain more attention and membership for your association depending on how your speaker performs so keep these questions in mind!
<h2>5. Reach out to your local Chamber of Commerce</h2>
<img class=""wp-image-15369 size-full aligncenter"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/会员粘性.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1920"" height=""1059"" />

Think of what your association has to offer to your members. Do your goals and mission align with something related to business in any way? If so, consider reaching out to your local Chamber of Commerce.

Many business owners join these organizations to increase visibility for their brand or area of business. Chambers of Commerce bring these businesses together and often host events for local businesses. Speakers they have hosted previously can have expertise in a topic that relates to your association’s interests. They could help provide contact information on past speakers who did a great job.
<h2>6. Ask what your audience wants to see</h2>

What does your audience want to get your event? What do they want to see more of at your events? Creating surveys can facilitate communicating with your audience and obtain the information you need. Participating in these forums, not only gives you a chance to learn and have questions answered, but also helps you identify a potential speaker for your upcoming event. Your attendees could also know or recommend people who would be great event speakers. This could later be implemented in your <a href=""https://blog.bizzabo.com/the-smart-event-marketing-playbook-blog"">event marketing strategy</a> to show potential attendees that the organizers are interesting to their attendees' recommendations and wants. Designing these forms can be easily made with websites such as <a href=""https://www.typeform.com/surveys/"">Typeform</a> and <a href=""http://www.surveymonkey.com/"">Survey Monkey</a>.

Don’t forget that your audience’s opinions about your speaker matters. How they react to a speaker can result in new membership signups. So if you collect data that shows overall satisfaction in your event, try to replicate that. Or even better, improve upon your success.
<h2>7. Does their content connect with the goals of the event?</h2>
While having an amazing and entertaining speaker is great for keeping the audience interested, are you still able to get your message across? The best type of speakers will ask you what that a successful night looks like. Whether it be certain topics they should mention or how to keep the audience engaged. Your speakers need to be able to incorporate your event's goal into their speeches in order to make your event successful. <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnhall/2016/06/05/the-importance-of-aligning-your-companys-online-and-offline-marketing-tactics/#65c904c92b58"">Aligning those goals and tactics</a> is the best way to have a successful event. Speakers should be able to deliver your message in a way that is unique to them and your audience won’t find elsewhere.
<h2>8. Think about events in the past that you have attended</h2>
While events provide an educational experience for attendees, it also opens many networking opportunities that can benefit your association. Other event planners probably put in a lot of work to find good speakers. Take advantage of their hard work for yourself and your upcoming event. If you’ve attended events in the past, you can attest to a speaker’s ability first hand. It also helps if you have established a connection with a potential speaker beforehand. With this in mind, as you continue to go to events, try to make connections with speakers since they can help you out with your own future events.

It can even get nitty-gritty with the exact <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/event-room-layouts/"">layout of the vent space</a>. How the speaker talks, the size of the audience, and more influence the layout of the event space and if you dont match it to the content being spoken, you may run the risk of bumming people out or outright upsetting audiences or speakers. Like forgetting to have a big enough screen for a space with lots of attendees, having the wrong table layout so people can't see the speaker adequately, and so on.
<h2>9. Who’s already influential in your field?</h2>
Experience and expertise can be great things to use to find a great speaker, but influence can be another quality to base speaker selection on. Take a look at your attendee lists, are there any names who have attended your events every year? Find those who attended your events and are very active and influential on social media, these people can often be great speakers. Try approaching them, they might be too shy to put themselves forward but clearly love your event and would like to share their experience with your audience. You can also try platforms such as <a href=""http://klout.com/home"">Klout</a> and <a href=""https://www.brandwatch.com/p/peerindex-and-brandwatch/"">PeerIndex + Brandwatch</a> to help you find influential people on specific topics. Finding someone who is passionate about the topic will often have the potential to attract more attendees to your event.
<h2>Now to you</h2>

As mentioned previously, using these tips in combination with one another can help you find the best speaker possible for your event, so don’t hesitate to do so. You can accomplish a lot for your event and association as a whole with a great speaker. With these tips, you should be able to find one that suits you and your member’s needs!

15906,"How to Write the Perfect Membership Invitation Email","Getting a membership invite right the first time can be challenging, not to mention time-consuming if you don’t know where to start - but it can not only considerably improve client engagement and membership acceptance but it gives you the chance to build valuable relationships and increase your number of members.

Membership invites are a chance to be passionate about your business and a chance to emphasize all you have to offer - this alone can be extremely persuasive.

But the question is: how do you make your membership email stand out? - Let’s take a look.

Looking for event invitation emails instead?<strong><a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/event-email-marketing-strategies/""> Check this article out!</a></strong>
<h2><b>The value of a membership invitation email</b></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-12227 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/vr-article-copy-65@2x.png"" alt=""invitation email "" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

A membership invitation email is a way for you to have direct contact with your potential future members. You have the ability to express the benefits of joining your organization and promote upcoming events - this is why it is important to make the message as personal, powerful and positive as possible.

A membership invitation email gives you the ability to reach a wider audience cost-effectively, sending emails to thousands of people all around the globe in just one click.
<h2><b>Who am I sending them too?</b></h2>
A membership invitation email can be sent to any contact whom you believe to have a specific interest in your business/product/work. For example; any associated connections you have, past and present clients, event sponsors and past members.
<h2><b>When is the best time to send the email?</b></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-11083 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rights-and-wrongs-event-catering@2x.png"" alt=""timing is important for emails"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Each day, the average office worker will receive around <a href=""https://techjury.net/stats-about/how-many-emails-are-sent-per-day/#gref"">120 emails per day! </a>This is why yours needs to be sent at just the right time so that out of those 120 emails, they read yours!
It is suggested that the best time to do this is <a href=""https://coschedule.com/blog/best-time-to-send-email/"">Tuesday and Thursday, </a>at 6am; as most of us start our day by reading emails, 10am and 8pm as we wind down for the day.

Likewise, logically thinking, the best time to send a membership invite could be when you have new events coming up that you would love to share with new members or you have a new product launch.

Or if you really want to get those memberships, you could do both!

Send your membership invitation email at 10am on Tuesday, as your biggest event of the year approaches.
<h2><b>So how do I write the perfect email?</b></h2>
<h3>Here’s a quick example</h3>
<b>Sender:</b> James Smith from EventBank.
<b>Subject Line</b>: Become a member today, Rachel.

<b>Copy:</b>

[What the company does]

[Membership benefits]

<ul>
 	<li>Enjoy members-only webinars</li>
 	<li>Reduced event fees</li>
 	<li>Exclusive VIP event entry.</li>
</ul>
[Upcoming events]

Thank you for your consideration, I look forward to hearing from you and hope to see you at our next event.

Best regards,

[Signature].
<h3>Subject line</h3>
Firstly, it’s important not to underestimate the power of a good subject line - <a href=""https://www.superoffice.com/blog/email-open-rates/"">47% of recipients open emails based on the subject line alone!</a>

So simply state within the subject line what the email is essentially about making it clear, but to ensure the email is actually opened <b>add the recipient’s name</b> to make it more personal. Are you working with a large list of contacts? Try leveraging email marketing software to help personalize lines of text with merge tags, that change the recipients' name in the salutation based on their email address and that address's name attached to it within your database.
<h3>Opening line</h3>
Start with a <i><a href=""https://www.thebalancecareers.com/letter-salutations-and-greetings-2059709"">salutation</a></i> - it is very important that you find out the recipients first and last name to start with ‘Dear Louise Myers,‘ it makes it more intimate and will encourage the recipient to read on with a positive attitude (if it’s not possible to find the addressess’ name ’Dear Sir/Madam’, is fine.

The opening lines of the email are the first thing the client will see - so make sure you are setting the right tone to continue the rest of the email, here are a few ideas of what you could start with:
<blockquote>We are delighted to invite you to join....
It is our pleasure to invite you to join....
Our company would be delighted to have you as a member....
I am pleased to invite you to join....</blockquote>
<h3>Main body</h3>
This is your chance for you to highlight <b>what you do</b> in your organization (awards) and how becoming a member can <b>positively benefit</b> the addressee - here you could express any membership privileges that are offered such as reduced event fees, exclusive VIP event tickets or member-only webinars.
Include how members help your business e.g. continuous support and help build your network.

Also now is a good time to <b>promote any upcoming events</b> that you may have, even better if you can tailor these events to the recipients' interests and preferences to enhance the membership potential.

Before ending the main body of your email it is important to ensure you have included a <b>quick and easy way to sign up</b> - people are more likely to sign up there and then if it is <a href=""https://www.helpscout.com/consumer-behavior/"">hassle free and cheaper.</a> E.g. ‘click here to sign up today and enjoy 25% off the first 3 months’.

The email is usually limited to one page but may be extended if you have the necessary attachments.
<h3>Closing statement and signature</h3>
The closing statement is your last chance to leave a lasting impression so make sure to thank the recipient for their consideration and reiterate the link to sign up. Likewise, express your pleasure of having them become a member. Here are a few phrases you may find helpful:
<blockquote>We hope you will accept our invitation to join us.....
We thank you for your consideration to join.....
We would be delighted to have you become part of our team....
Don’t forget to sign up today and get 25% off your first 3 months....
We look forward to welcoming you as a new member...</blockquote>
Lastly, include your contact information and encourage them to openly contact you with any questions they may have - if writing on behalf of a company, <b>include your title. </b>

Signing off - this can be simply done by typing your name or using an electronic signature - this tends to be a more thoughtful approach via email, if you don’t have one already <a href=""https://newoldstamp.com/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=invitation-letter-business-meeting"">here’s how you can get started.</a>
<h2><b>Final things to remember! </b></h2>
<ul>
 	<li style=""list-style-type: none;"">
<ul>
 	<li><b>Proofread!!</b></li>
 	<li>Make it as personal as you can</li>
 	<li>Keep it short and easy to follow</li>
 	<li>Be authentic, do not use unnecessary flattery</li>
 	<li>Try not to use “Dear member” - remember it needs to be personal</li>
 	<li>Don’t forget to add contact information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

15931,"6 Ways Automating Membership Management Helps Your Association","Keeping membership data and information up to date can be difficult, especially as your association grows and changes. As your memberships grow, there are more payments, renewals, and exit dates to keep track of. Investing in automating your association’s memberships is important to your association since it can help you manage your memberships in a quick and simple way.

It also saves time and money, which can be put towards other important tasks within your association. Automating memberships can help you compete in an ever-changing and competitive market. Here are a few ways how it can do so:
<h2>Improve Customer Retention</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5484 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/EventBank-Membership-flow.png"" alt=""automate membership renewal reminders"" width=""1369"" height=""739"" />

Customer retention is important for any business but can often be overlooked when marketing to new consumers.

While customer acquisition is important, customer retention can prove to be even more valuable. According to <a href=""http://www2.bain.com/Images/BB_Prescription_cutting_costs.pdf"">Bain &amp; Company</a> research, profits increase from 25% to 95% if customer retention rates increase by a mere 5%.

It is also estimated that <strong>80% of a company’s revenue will come from 20% of its existing customers</strong>. It is important to remember that your association can only have so many members. It’s important to foster a good relationship with those you already have.

With these statistics in mind, it is easy to see why customer retention is important for your business. And as more companies and associations focus on customer acquisition, it is important for you to do the same in order to remain competitive in your market.

Automating your membership profiles can help you with customer retention. Exit and renewal dates can be difficult to keep track of: both for your consumer and for your association. The automation of reminder emails makes it easier to remind current members of renewal dates, which makes it easier to retain them as a customer. This saves you and your team time and energy that can be allotted elsewhere.

See the process in motion in the video below. 👇

&nbsp;
<h2>Enhance Membership Engagement</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-12122 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/assoc-member-grow-blog-copy-20@2x-1024x423.png"" alt="""" width=""1024"" height=""423"" />

Keeping your members engaged can be difficult. Although this is true, membership engagement and customer retention go hand in hand. If your members feel that they are not benefitting from what your association has to offer, they’re more likely to leave. You actually may have lots to offer but how you present that information matters.

It’s not practical to expect your association’s members to check your websites for new events or workshops, especially with their busy schedules.

Engaged members are also expected to be more profitable. According to a <a href=""https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/172637/why-customer-engagement-matters.aspx"">Gallup</a> study, fully engaged members represent an average 23% <i>premium</i> in terms of share of wallet, profitability, revenue, and relationship growth compared with the average customer.

Instead of having your members come to you, you should come to them. Investing in an automated system that emails members and alerts them of the events you are hosting can increase engagement. It makes it easier for them to see your content and for you to get their attention.

Not to mention the time you saved by automating rather than sending those emails by hand! For more tips on how to improve membership engagement, check out our post, <a href=""https://blog.eventbank.com/boost-membership-engagement/"">6 Ways to Boost Your Association’s Membership Engagement</a>.
<h2>Show Your Commitment to Your Members</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5407 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/membership-welcome-package-2-1024x550.png"" alt=""membership welcome package"" width=""1024"" height=""550"" />

Although being able to reach out to your members is important, just simply doing so is not enough. With the average office worker receiving around 90 emails a day, you need to be able to stick out and communicate your message to your members.

With your members receiving this number of emails, you want to be able to show your association’s dedication to your individual members. You can do this through email personalization.

According to <a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/260678/e-mail-open-click-rates-personalization/"">one study</a>, in 2016 the open rate for emails with personalized messages was about 19% while emails without personalization were only about<strong> 13%</strong>. With this in mind, it’s clear that you cannot rely on generic emails to grab your members’ attention.

The personalization of emails can make a world of difference when it comes to your campaigns. It can lead to better engagement and retention of members. While personalizing emails may seem difficult and daunting, much-automated membership software is capable of helping you with this task as well!

You can access different templates that make your emails look unique and professional. Automated membership profiles often come with the ability to start emails with member’s names, making your communications even more personal.
<h2>Reduce Costs</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-11027 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/saveyourchamber-edm-2@2x-1024x393.png"" alt="""" width=""1024"" height=""393"" />

Running an association can be a costly endeavor. From operational costs to time itself, you have to spend something in order to run your association. Some of these costs arise in the way you handle your memberships. Do you keep paper records of your memberships?

Do you spend a lot of time updating membership data? The time and resources spent on accomplishing these things can be put into other tasks. Cutting down on this time can help you focus on other work that can help your association grow.

Membership automation saves you time and money by putting all your membership-related activities in one platform. Members’ information can be updated system-wide with a few clicks, you can create marketing emails to alert members of events and much more on one system.

An automated system would put an end to window-hopping for information. You and your team will also spend less time generating renewal emails that can be sent out automatically with an automated system.
<h2>Conduct Analysis to Improve Your Association</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15108 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/eventbank-exploration-patterns-1-copy-13@2x-1024x549.png"" alt="""" width=""1024"" height=""549"" />

Sometimes it can feel like your association or business is stuck in a rut. You may be having trouble planning your next move. Even if your association is doing well, it doesn’t hurt to examine the ways in which you can improve and plan ahead accordingly for the future.

This can be done by conducting an analysis of your members and what they want out of you as a company. One <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/five-facts-how-customer-analytics-boosts-corporate-performance"">McKinsey</a> study states that intensive users of customer analytics are 23 times more likely to clearly outperform their competitors in terms of new-customer acquisition than non-intensive users, and nine times more likely to surpass them in customer loyalty.

With this in mind, automatization of your association membership can provide you with an analysis of what works for your customers and what doesn’t. Who contributes the most profit overtime and who doesn’t? What grabs your members’ interest? What events do they like and can you duplicate that in the future?

These are some questions that data and analytics can help you answer. These answers can improve your associations’ membership retention and engagement. On top of this, you can discover what strategies are giving you problems and correct them accordingly, increasing members’ satisfaction in your association.
<h2>Overall Convenient for Both Customer and Employee</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-10064 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/member-boost@2x.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Time is of the essence of whether you are a growing or starting company. Customers want to be able to navigate through your platform with ease and speed. The last thing customers want to receive is pesky email or phone calls asking if their information is up to date.

They want to be able to update their information within a click of a button whenever the time comes. Whether it is updating the type of membership they want or changing their payment plans, customers want to be able to focus that time and effort onto more important tasks. Today, it’s all about <a href=""https://www.superoffice.com/blog/customer-experience-strategy/"">the customer experience</a>.

With CRM software, customers can have their questions answered faster and receive information tailored to them.

By adopting the right technology not only will it free up your teams from process-heavy tasks but allows for more time to connect with customers. “Fifty-two percent of high-performing salespeople identified themselves as power users who take full advantage of their companies’ CRM technology”, (HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW).

Automation across sales, service, and marketing will free your employees so they can spend more time talking to prospective customers and strengthening relationships with existing ones, helping your business to continue moving forward.

With platforms such as CRM employees will no longer have to personally hunt for contact information or manually enter data into all their systems. Employees can also utilize CRM platforms to respond to customer inquiries faster by using <a href=""https://www.superoffice.com/blog/customer-service-email-templates-for-business/"">ready-made email templates</a>.

With pre-made templates, employees no longer have to worry about sending out the same response to frequently asked questions. Employees will be able to use that gained time to sell smarter and faster. Overall customer data and sharing it between departments will enable your employees to work as a team and optimize the customer experience.
<h2>Now on to you</h2>
The modern association exists in a world that has access to ever-changing and improving technologies. Why not use them to your advantage? Automating your memberships can lead to so many benefits for your association as a whole. First and foremost, automation can help you with the task of keeping members happy and satisfied.

It provides a firsthand look into what your members want, what catches their attention, and how you can improve to suit their interests. Not to mention how you can reduce costs when you switch to an all-encompassing system. With these things in mind, consider automating your memberships! You never know how your association may grow.

MMA’s mission is to accelerate the transformation and innovation of marketing through mobile, driving business growth with closer and stronger consumer engagement. By enlightening, empowering and enabling marketers, the MMA has been shaping future success, while propelling business growth today.

MMA runs three key think tanks to address crucial aspects of modern marketing (1) Marketing Attribution Think Tank (MATT) – MATT is a community of marketing industry leaders, including marketers, attribution experts, academics, and other thought-leaders in the marketing ecosystem, charged with rethinking the world of marketing attribution and providing better measurements, tools, and confidence within the industry, in connecting marketing to business outcomes; (2) MMA SMARTIES – The SMARTIES are the world’s only global mobile marketing awards program honoring innovation, creativity and success. In addition to the regional Asia Pacific SMARTIES Awards, MMA holds dedicated SMARTIES awards in India, Indonesia and Vietnam. With the evolution of the mobile landscape, MMA has incorporated new categories covering emerging technologies such as Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality and the Internet of Things. The 2019 Asia Pacific SMARTIES have received over 360 entries from across 14 markets; (3) Ad Fraud Roadshow – Ad fraud is one of the biggest marketing issues brands face these days. To help marketers combat ad fraud, the MMA organized Ad Fraud roadshows in India (Bangalore, Mumbai and New Delhi) and Indonesia (Jakarta), with the aim of uniting key stakeholders of the industry (advertisers, publishers, agencies) to educate the audience and talk about a common method to eradicate ad fraud or lessen the impact it has on all parties.

The Singapore Veterinary Association (SVA) is Singapore's only veterinary-related association for the veterinary profession. The SVA's Executive Committee is made up entirely of volunteers with no part-time and full-time staff. By leveraging on technology and strategic partnerships, the current Executive Committee has managed to increase the SVA membership rates to a record high in the past year (33%). This is an indication of the amount of value created for members. This achievement is impressive for an Executive Committee run entirely on volunteers. Being in the medical profession, veterinarians are required to attain Continuing Professional Education to keep abreast of recent developments and practices. However, there is a lack of veterinary academia in Singapore and the market size is relatively small. Practicing veterinarians also have inflexible schedules. To ensure access to high quality education by all members, the SVA is doing a big push to collaborate with high-quality and reputable organizations and individuals to come up with a wide range of Continuing Professional Education programs and materials and bringing them to Singapore, physically and online. This is unlikely to happen naturally without SVA spearheading these efforts.
<blockquote><em>“The Singapore Veterinary Association is a prime example of how to make the most effective use of limited resources. Despite the limited resources and no employees, they have achieved to build a highly functional and engaged scientific community.“</em>

It had been seven years since the Asia Pacific Tree Climbing Championship (APTCC) had been held in New Zealand, and the feeling across the New Zealand climbing community and from NZ Arboricultural was that they all wanted to make APTCC Christchurch 2019 an event to remember for those participating and for the community hosting it. Over the course of the last 12 months preceding the event many hours of toil where been invested by many people to turn that vision into that event. A successful international level sporting event like APTCC couldn’t just run on enthusiasm and volunteer hours alone however, and the investment and partnership secured from the commercial sponsors helped turn that vision into reality and create an event that the arboriculture industry in New Zealand was proud to share with wider international arboriculture community and with the people of Christchurch.

While the event was essentially an international level sporting event for the top-level tree climbers, the opportunity also helped to get the community of Christchurch involved in the event and leave behind, not only memories of an exhilarating sporting event in Christchurch’s iconic Botanic Gardens, but a legacy of increased appreciation of the importance of Christchurch’s tree assets and their benefits to the communities they serve.
<blockquote><em>“The event's success is gauged not only on the attendee size but more on the advocacy it promotes.”</em>

The Bayanihang Arkitektura is one of the programs of the UAP which aim to improve the lives of the community through architecture planning and promoting sustainable design solutions that can provide significant positive impact on the underprivileged communities. Mindful of giving back to the community, UAP strives to be a catalyst for positive change, and support communities to lead healthier, longer, better lives through a broad range of activities under the Bayanihang Arkitektura program.

The Bayanihang Arkitektura program is designed to address many of the common challenges communities face by producing long-term sustainability plans that are realistic and reflect each community’s unique context. Key features of the program approach include the following: water and sanitation, architectural clinic, rehabilitation of public schools, community development and emergency architects.

The Bayanihang Arkitektura was designed as a long-term effort of the UAP to develop diverse initiatives to promote architect’s social responsibility in improving well-being of communities, as UAP recognizes that the social, economic and environmental responsibilities are integral to existence.

15977,"Strategic vs Operational Plans: How Africa can Streamline Membership Management","At the first-ever African Association Summit, EventBank had a chance to speak with some of Africa's biggest movers in associations, and see how their planning fits in with their membership management strategy. Is it a set of operational plans put into place that granularly improve efficiency and communication? What if it was just purely strategic in nature?

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16014 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/73090721_721175535065110_3206949133852082176_o-1024x683.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1024"" height=""683"" />

Perfecting membership management can be a perplexing yet extremely rewarding process. It requires well-considered approaches at both strategic and operational levels. Also requiring resourceful processes and systems to be put in place, making the progression as hassle-free as possible. If not done right, it could see member retention declining and majorly cost you and your company significant time.

So it is time to say hello to the age of relevance. Members in Africa want to be in unison with the rest of the world. They want to have personalized systems, customized rewards and desire global connectivity. This new age of relevance means it’s time to ditch the mass marketing and mediocre membership benefits. African members are devoted and more empowered than ever before and there has never been a better time to streamline your membership management.

Let’s take a closer look and see what we can do.

<h2>Strategic Vs. Operational Planning</h2>
<h3>Strategic Planning</h3>
A strategic plan tends to be primarily focused on the long-term mission, vision, and goals of your business for the next three to five years. It summaries how you will best measure these goals and what steps you need to take in order to reach them.

<span style=""color: #339966;""><b>Time period</b></span> - Outlines long-term goals, usually the next three to five years

<b><span style=""color: #339966;"">Goal Focus</span> – </b>Summarizes the company’s long-term visions

<b><span style=""color: #339966;"">Plan Generation</span> - </b>High-level leadership team are accountable for creating the strategic plan

<b><span style=""color: #339966;"">Budget</span> - </b>Strategic Expenditure offers valuable and careful financial planning which can help budget for investment and create positions of accountability

<b><span style=""color: #339966;"">Reporting</span> - </b>Usually high-level and done quarterly
<h3>Operational</h3>
This plan is an outline of what your department will focus on for the near future—usually the upcoming year.

<span style=""color: #339966;""><b>Time period </b></span>- What you’ll be doing to achieve those goals in the shorter term (typically the next fiscal year)

<b><span style=""color: #339966;"">Goal Focus</span> - </b>Department-focused

<b><span style=""color: #339966;"">Plan Generation</span> - </b>Department leaders are responsible for creating their operational plan

<b><span style=""color: #339966;"">Budget</span> -</b> Department’s annual budget

<b><span style=""color: #339966;"">Reporting</span> - </b>Outline hundreds of projects or tasks people in the department are working on (monthly)

Understanding them does not mean you choose one - you will need to implement a strategic plan as well as an operational one if you hope to achieve your goals.

However, most departments already have some sort of operational plan in place. So you don’t need to worry about starting from scratch; merely put your existing plan into a system that helps you to perform at a superior level.
<h2>Africa's Challenges with Membership Management</h2>
<h3>Membership Engagement and Retention Gaps</h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15998 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Membership-ROI.jpg"" alt="""" width=""874"" height=""793"" />

We all know how important high engagement is in when it comes to keeping organizations healthy and progressing towards their mission. Yet <a href=""https://advsol.com/asi/Press/2019/asi_releases_annual_membership_survey_report.aspx"">68% of African associations</a> found retention was unchanged or had declined since 2018 and only 34% reported an increase in member engagement in 2019.
<h3>Lack of Personalization and Rewards</h3>
<a href=""https://www.pagelizard.com/our-blog/top-challenges-facing-membership-organisations/"">Three – quarters of membership</a> organizations are finding it difficult to provide personalized content to their members via their website or other channels, with most simply imputing members' names to personalize. It is clear however in this day and age that a lot more effort is required with much better use of analytics in order to support a more sophisticated personalization system that is to be based around members’ behavior and or engagement history.

Arguably one of the most important drivers of member engagement is the perceived value of rewards and benefits offered, yet <a href=""http://www.eighty20.co.za/2018-loyalty-programme-member-engagement-survey/"">48% of people in Africa</a> deactivated their membership accounts due to reward dissatisfaction or complicated processes.
<h3>Organizational Inactivity on Social Media</h3>
With the total number of active users on social media rising to <a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/685134/south-africa-digital-population/"">2 million</a> in Africa, it is vital for organizations to best utilize these platforms to encourage membership retention. However, it is surprising to learn that <a href=""https://www.pagelizard.com/our-blog/top-challenges-facing-membership-organisations/"">only half are regularly monitoring</a> their social media platforms meaning they don’t actually have an organized social media strategy in place. Therefore, it often gets forgotten about and disregarded.
<h2>How to Best Streamline These Challenges</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15991 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/membership-growth.jpg"" alt=""membership growth tactics"" width=""1501"" height=""672"" />
<h3>Membership Engagement &amp; Retention</h3>
It's impossible to retain 100% of your members, even if you have a vast marketing budget and do everything right, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be doing everything you can. Here are a few ways to keep retention high:

<b>Organize and promote appealing events </b>for members and the community. It’s important to keep not just your members, but also non-members who are impacted by your organization. Events promote communication, engagement, and ideas to be shared and expressed which can either influence your stakeholders or yourself.

<b>Offer membership perks and benefits </b>to retain your members, and keep them reminded why they joined. You can also include goals and milestones to encourage them to renew in order to meet milestones that give some sort of reward. A <a href=""http://www.eighty20.co.za/2018-loyalty-programme-member-engagement-survey/"">survey carried out with African</a><b> </b>consumers found that people are more likely to stay a member if they are getting something back but it must be exclusive and not offered by other organizations.

<b>Survey existing members </b>as to what their ideas or experiences have been. This obviously helps you identify where your organization can improve. This is particularly important when it comes to members leaving, so it’s crucial to survey members as to their reason for not renewing or canceling.

<b>Operate an easy renewal system </b>by making it go digital, and automating the repetitive tasks needed to remind members when their membership is coming to an end, alert them of late or failed payments, deliver discounts for last-minute renewals, and so on. This type of communication can be automated with digital membership management software, but can also be done manually if you have same-day renewal dates, though in most cases members have their own individual renewal dates.

<b>Create a content calendar </b>as<b> </b>content that exists in your organization is important. It can help better the experience of members, so make sure you’re placing the right content in the right channel, whether that’s social media posts, a blog, videos, or events. Listen to your community and be malleable to what engages them.

<b>Encourage a thriving and engaged community </b>by making sure your internal organization structure is porous. Allow members to have a place to call home, most notably on a mobile app, so that members can search for each other, engage in chat or email, and otherwise foster a sense of free communication and collaboration among members. This too, can often mean there is a lesser need for you to manually engage with the community each time.
<h3>Personalization and Rewards</h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5407 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/membership-welcome-package-2-1024x550.png"" alt=""membership welcome package"" width=""1024"" height=""550"" />

<a href=""https://www.sinch.com/blog/the-era-of-loyalty-marketing-is-over-welcome-to-the-age-of-relevance/"">Welcome to the age of relevance</a>, where mass marketing and segmentation are no longer beneficial. Members are now more than ever, harder to please and a lot more fickle. Therefore, companies need ways to make them feel empowered. In other words, offering a service like no other and building a deeper relationship with each member - as on average in Africa consumers have a membership with <a href=""http://www.eighty20.co.za/2018-loyalty-programme-member-engagement-survey/"">9 other programs</a><b>.</b>

<a href=""https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/462/185117.html"">One in four</a> consumers stated that they are willing to pay more for a personalized product or service, so why would you assume any different for your members? Also, <a href=""https://woocommerce.com/posts/personalize-content-members/"">74% </a>of adults admitted that they feel frustrated when they are shown website content that “has nothing to do with them”, so don’t risk losing members this way as it is easy to do when you have the right knowledge.

A membership shouldn’t be the same for everyone, you need to make it personal. This doesn’t just mean adding their name to a frequent email blast, but carefully customizing their content to best suit their interests - sending them appropriate events or articles which they have shown considerable interest in previously. This can be done by simply accessing their member history and planning content accordingly. It assures members that they matter to you and that you spend time making sure they are satisfied.

<a href=""http://www.eighty20.co.za/2018-loyalty-programme-member-engagement-survey/"">African members want rewards</a>, but not just any rewards, personal ones. They trust reward programs more when they make things clear and give them what they want. Nor do they want to have to jump through hoops to get these rewards. They want to be understood, appreciated and acknowledged. So do your research and give rewards to members that will actually appeal to them, keeping retention high.
<h3>Use of social media</h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15303 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/eventbank-exploration-patterns-8-copy-8@2x-1024x549.png"" alt=""membership social media"" width=""1024"" height=""549"" />

Virtual engagement is important to members, especially Gen Z and Millenials who don’t forget, are more <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/za/blog/intentional-insights/201909/how-associations-can-improve-new-member-retention?amp"">introverted and digitally oriented</a>. So, make sure you have a comfortable and appealing platform for them to visit. Social media is an extremely effective way to do this.

Facebook and YouTube seem to be the most popular in Africa with <a href=""https://gs.statcounter.com/social-media-stats/all/africa"">63.73% using Facebook, </a>15.95% using Youtube and only 5.03% using Instagram. In this case, it is a good idea to share your articles, blog posts and promote upcoming events on Facebook while creating more interesting and often factual video content for Youtube.

It is important to remember that just because African members may not be using the same platforms like the US for example. It doesn’t mean you should stop targeting them. Facebook and YouTube are an extremely and very cost-effective way to reach your members in Africa. Ensuring they feel like they are apart of something special, so encourage interaction as much as possible. Posting virtual polls on Facebook and uploading YouTube videos to get your members talking. This type of positive engagement is sure to increase retention.
<h2>Implementing the Correct Strategic Plans</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15996 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Membership-Retention-Strategies-1024x365.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1024"" height=""365"" />
<h3>Secure Actionable Research</h3>
Acquiring futuristic data is essential. For instance, applying “impact” survey data instead of member satisfaction surveys which will help your organization determine the relevant future outcomes that members really seek to address.
<h3>Demonstrate Strategic Alignment</h3>
Tactically aligning your member’s industry with its professional outcome, is key to your association’s long term stability and development. Without a recognizable level of strategic alignment, members will not notice the important association between your organization and its business outcomes. Those who are aligned with your business challenges and outcomes are relevant because they relate to what really matters.
<h3>Design the Industry’s Future</h3>
Acting as a leader for your industry generates the strongest potential link between your organization and the members you serve. This relationship is reinforced when you can deliver a safe space for your members to collaborate and plan their future together.
<h3>Be Data Focused</h3>
Make sure that you are sharing any new or developing research insights that might give company owners, executives, entrepreneurs, employees, and investors an opening into new and emerging market opportunities. This will, in turn, provide real and tangible value to members.
<h2>Implementing the Correct Operational Plans</h2>
<h3>Members' Digital Expectations</h3>
Millennials and Gen Z, now expect tangible benefits and progressive outcomes in return for their annual membership subscription fee. Such as career enhancement, work/life balance solutions and/or targeted help/support. So be sure to provide at much of this as possible and deliver it to the best standard as possible as this new tech-savvy generation has high digital expectations and doesn’t often accept anything less.
<h3>Getting Members to Connect with Each Other</h3>
Getting members to connect can be challenging but it is extremely important if they want to increase retention. Connections are formed by people, not the organization, so pose questions and ask for constant feedback to increase discussions.
<h3>Understanding Members</h3>
There are multiple types of members and organizations need to be simultaneously delivering personalized benefits in order to keep them satisfied. This involves listening to what they have to say and tracking any previous interest and behavior so that you can best tailor to their needs.
<h2>Importance of Technology</h2>
Technology supports deeper engagement and when used successfully can provide a more relevant and well-rounded member experience.

It can be suggested that the main root of these challenges is missing technology. Such as inefficient processes, unstructured data, fragmented collaboration, and simply non-existent tools.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15999 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Missing-Technology-1024x416.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1024"" height=""416"" />

It’s important that companies are staying in tune with the latest technology and most efficient systems. For instance, in order to personalize content, firms need to be able to track applications, recent behavior, and registration and this can be very time consuming if done manually and this is where some firms are missing out.

Likewise, collecting and storing member data in a simple excel sheet is not going to show you the bigger picture, it will simply list your members' essential data but leave gaps, making it harder to customize and distinguish member needs.

16049,"Events and Technology are Building Communities in Malaysia","It’s no secret that hosting events are a good way to bring people together.

Events bring in people with similar interests and concerns and try to encourage interaction between one another. Regardless if you’re looking to host a charity event, a workshop, or even a movie night, these all have the potential to create or strengthen a community.

If you’re looking for tips on how to successfully build a community of passionate and engaged members through your events, keep reading because, in Malaysia, we can see events starting to create communities and encourage new discussions. Here's how they're leveraging events and technology to grow the events that grow their communities.
<h2>Creating Good Email Campaigns</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3292 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Email-Campaigns-Ad-Copy@2x-1024x549.png"" alt=""event email marketing guide"" width=""1024"" height=""549"" />

Between 2017 to 2018, Malaysia saw a significant jump in its email open rate. It <span style=""color: #333399;""><strong>grew from 16.52% in 2017 to 23.38%</strong></span> in 2018.

With this data, we can see that emails are becoming increasingly important in regard to a marketing standpoint in Malaysia. With this in mind, it’s becoming increasingly important for you to create good email campaigns that people will want to open. Doing so will increase the likelihood of people both knowing and attending your event. Here are some examples of great <strong><a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/event-email-marketing-strategies/"">event invite emails.</a></strong>

Effective email campaigns are vital to an event’s success. First and foremost, choose a simple subject line for your emails that still relays the message you want to convey. One tip is to start off with action words. This keeps your message short yet powerful. Never leave a subject line blank.

There’s no faster way for your email to end up in the trash! Keep email design in mind too. The design of your emails should look professional and eye-catching. Your audience won’t want to read a plain-looking email. The addition of photos, clean-looking fonts, and striking colors can call attention to your event’s email campaign.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15525 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/7E6D5E16-5EE3-47C1-8789-08ED7CB16A57-1024x549.png"" alt=""email success"" width=""1024"" height=""549"" />

You can also maximize the effectiveness of your email campaign through how you time it and the content you provide during each stage of the campaign. It doesn’t make sense to start an email campaign a few days short of your event. You want to gain interest in your event over time. Use this time to garner attention for your event in a relatively organic way. Send multiple emails that first catch people’s curiosity. Then, relay the urgency and relevancy of your event.

Even once the event is over, you want to follow up with attendees. These follow up emails can include surveys so you can learn how to improve your next event. It also shows that you care about the attendee experience and are willing to nurture the attendee-organizer relationship.

You can’t build a community without people, so make sure to get your potential attendee’s attention through your email campaigns. You can potentially lose a few valuable and loyal community members if you don’t market your events well. So keep this in mind when trying to build your communities!
<h2>Collecting Data</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15108 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/eventbank-exploration-patterns-1-copy-13@2x-1024x549.png"" alt=""event data collection"" width=""1024"" height=""549"" />

&nbsp;

Many times when host events people forget or miss the opportunity to collect data that can come in handy later. Event data is essential in helping planners and organizations understand exactly what happened at your events and how you can improve.

Hosting events allows the collection of both qualitative or quantitative data that can be later used to bring to communities together to collaborate. Because events tend to attract people in similar industries or interests, it will facilitate the collection of data that specifically correlated to your event. It is also mare likely that data collected will be coming from reliable.

This can be done by implementing a forum or survey into your event. Not only will this make it easier for your attendees to provide you with information but it will also be easier for you to organize the data you have collected and look at it later.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1525 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/crm@2x.png"" alt=""CRM, event ROI"" width=""880"" height=""846"" />

Once you have determined an issue or a goal you believe is important to your audience, the next step is to critically examine the data you have identified. Whether it is data as simple as, were the guest speakers informative, to was the food provided well served.

Upon finding the information you were looking for you will be able to either target those issues that are urgent and clear to the community or find common goals. This newfound information can then be implemented into your next event or shared with those in the community.

Collecting data on things such as sessions, speakers, meals, accommodations, activities, and other topics can throughout the event, can be sorted and used to improve the design for your future events.
<h2>Improvement of Attendee Experiences</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5906 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_7533-Edit-1024x576.jpg"" alt=""Keeping members happy"" width=""1024"" height=""576"" />

It is currently estimated that the number of smartphone users in Malaysia is 18.4 million. This number is projected to grow up to 20.9 million in 2023. Our world is becoming increasingly intertwined with technology. This technology is making our lives more convenient with a plethora of life-simplifying apps and information at millions of peoples’ fingertips.

With so many people having smartphones nowadays, it would only make sense to take advantage of it. So how can you implement this type of convenience into your event? As mentioned previously, smartphones’ are known for their convenience. Use them to make your event more convenient. This can be done in a simple way: Having an app for your attendees to manage their events.

Event apps can help simplify event registration, payment, ticketing, and much more. With an event app, registration becomes much easier and faster. This makes it more appealing to potential attendees, who won’t have to go through the usual hassle of registration.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15732 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bl-1-1024x683.jpg"" alt=""WLA Check in"" width=""1024"" height=""683"" />

Apps also have the capacity to accept payments, once again making the user experience rather convenient. Users would have your event app as a quick option instead of having to go onto the internet, search up your event’s ticketing website, and input their payment information and email, etc.

One aspect of event attendance that can still be quite a hassle as well as event ticketing. Typically, an attendee would pay for their ticket a few days or even a few months in advance. This ticket then goes to their email which usually gets buried under piles of other emails.

When the time for the event comes, their tickets suddenly become elusive, requiring either long hours spent scrolling or racking one’s brain for keywords to search in their inbox’s search bar. An event app takes that hassle away, putting tickets and QR codes all in one easily accessible place.

By eliminating the hassles of event participation, you can attract more attendees to your event. Continually offering these hassle-free services can help you create a group of regular event attendees, who, with your help, can get to know one another and form a strong community.
<h2>Create an Online Forums &amp; Discussions</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5899 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_7506-Edit-1024x683.jpg"" alt=""host events for members"" width=""1024"" height=""683"" />

While having good attendance numbers at your events are always good, how will your attendees be able to stay in contact with each other or discuss the event. With Malaysia‘s current 24.1 million social network users, online forums can be widely shared through social platforms.

Malaysia’s 23 million users on Facebook alone make up about 95% of their overall social network users. Making it fairly easy for you attendees to quickly and easily access your online forum but posting them on popular social platforms.

Having an online forum can be used to gather a wide range of data for multiple purposes. One purpose could be as simple as exchanging contact information with each other. This will facilitate the possibility of collaborating between companies and other future events.

Not only will others be able to communicate, but you will also be able to receive feedback on your event. The feedback you receive will allow you to capture the data that you require or want. Collecting data such as was the space your event hosted at easy to find or if they found the event overall helpful.

With 49% of Malaysia’s population using smartphones, online forms can easily be accessed across mobile devices. Therefore widening the reach of how many people can access your form to fill it in. An online forum can reduce costs and increase efficiency, standardization, and accuracy.

By linking or building in surveys to your forums will save you both time and money. Utilizing free websites such as <a href=""https://www.surveymonkey.com/"">SurveyMonkey</a> can easily be made with pre-made templates. These surveys will guarantee the questions you are asking are consistent and distributed to everyone at your event.

By using the forum in a face to face environment, you can ensure that your attendees and teams are engaged and allowed to make suggestions. It will also make dealing with customer complaints, gathering personal details or even when taking an order faster.
<h2>How are you building up?</h2>
If you’re organizing an event, give these tips a try! The addition of these features to your event can make a world of difference when trying to build communities. Eliminating the hassle, learning what attendees want from you, and marketing your event well can impact the amount of engaged and regular attendees your event has. It is these engages and regular attendees that help create your community.

EventBank's platform offers event management and email campaign software that can make the planning of your event a breeze, and help grow that community by actively and automatically engaging them with the content they love.<strong> Book a demo</strong> today and we'll show you how it works.

16133,"How Singapore's Organizations can Excel without Excel","Excel is great! It’s affordable, it’s straightforward and it’s so easy to use. But don’t you think it’s time we moved on to something better?

Excel is holding you back, whether you know it or not. we’ve become far too comfortable with it and Singapore organizations need to break this habit and finally admit that it isn’t something you love, it’s something you are simply used to. Some organizations are owning up to this challenge and taking it on head first.

Let’s see what lies beyond your crowded cells.

<h2 id=""challenges"">Excel’s Biggest Drawbacks</h2>
<h3>It’s offline</h3>
<img class=""notfull wp-image-16151 size-full aligncenter"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/376356-200.png"" alt="""" width=""200"" height=""200"" />

Excel works offline which means you are unable to connect your excel sheet to relevant and extremely helpful tools - this is such a shame as there are so many creative and more effective ways to be integrating and connecting your data.

Yes, there is some API access, and yes, there are ways to connect your sheets to certain Microsoft of Google ordained capabilities, but this is still rather limited compared to a bespoke integration.

Not to mention, copies of Excel sheets inevitably leak, get borrowed, or shared among internal or even external parties. Do you remember which sheet is your latest? Which sheet has last month’s update? Who owns the latest sheet?

See what we mean? There’s ways to back up data and centralize a master document, but once a copy is made, it’s to the whim of the owner of that copy whether it’s going to find it’s way back to the master sheet, and as we all know, that’s a risk organizations really shouldn’t take.
<h3>All your eggs are in <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">one basket</span></h3>
<img class=""notfull wp-image-16152 size-medium aligncenter"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/broken-egg-1465444-1240868-204x204.png"" alt="""" width=""204"" height=""204"" />

Your financial data and all of your client information are easily accessible to everyone in your organization not to mention extremely easy to hack with a simple password protecting it in devices.

This isn’t good for anyone. You don’t want your interns to see all your private financial information and your clients definitely don’t want their private information seen by the whole organization or even worse, stolen without a trace.

<a href=""https://home.kpmg/sg/en/home/media/press-releases/2016/11/companies-that-fail-to-see-privacy-as-a-business-priority-risk-crossing-the-creepy-line.html"">70% of Singaporeans </a>are not convinced that companies are doing enough to protect their personal data. They feel insecure when online and often don’t trust a lot of organizations easily. Can you trust that Excel has your security in mind?

Your average Singaporean values their data, so be careful with it!
<h3>Copies everywhere</h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16153 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Copies-Everywhere.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1153"" height=""604"" />

When using Excel, the number of copies you need is exhausting not to mention super confusing for everyone. How can you possibly keep everything up-to-date? What if someone was offline and you made changes, they will come back and have no idea what was changed, if it even was changed and who changed it.

While the Office 365 web version does automatically save, the downloadable version of Excel, which is often used over the web version due to full functionality, can be detrimental if there’s a crash.

There are methods to keep copies in check but oftentimes these third-party tools cost money, and there’s no way to know if this third party is trustworthy of this data.
<h3>Where are your backups?</h3>
Backing up your data is so important. It is sadly very easy for your excel sheet (holding all of your key data) to be stolen, corrupted or deleted at the click of a button. You need a master sheet, one that people have access to edit, and update, somewhere that if it gets deleted, it is still retrievable.

Without a master copy, people are not accountable for their changes and international discussions are a lot harder as people can not access, update and edit in real-time.

The good news is the latest versions of Excel are leveraging organizational logins to keep track of actions taken, so, with a master sheet, in the event of mistakes that are not caught in time, admins have the ability to look back at changelogs that show who or what the change was made, and when.

This does give the ability to go back and undo damage, but a vast majority of organizations are not running the latest version of Excel, opting for more simple past versions.
<h3>Not mobile-friendly</h3>
<a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/558852/number-of-mobile-internet-user-in-singapore/"">4.6 million </a>consumers in Singapore are accessing the internet via their mobile phones. They value the fact that data is available at their very fingertips. However, Excel is not mobile-friendly. Meaning every time you wish to access it with a clear picture or without misaligned data, it needs to be done at a desk with your laptop, not convenient at all.

So, should we say goodbye to Excel now?
<h2 id=""cloud"">Going to the Cloud with Membership Management Software</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15214 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/eventbank-exploration-patterns-1-copy-16@2x-1024x549.png"" alt=""digital transformation can impact event attendee experience"" width=""1024"" height=""549"" />

Membership Management Software is like Excel sheets on steroids, and it very narrowly solves many of the headaches your organization might be encountering. After operating in Singapore for the past few years, EventBank has been engaging with our associations and chamber of commerce customers in order to find out how exactly membership management software is helping your average Singapore organization in ways that Excel can’t.
<h3>It’s online</h3>
On the cloud more precisely.

By the nature of this software and others like it like Salesforce, access to the software can happen anywhere there’s an internet connection.

But beyond this, the software is in a perpetual state of real-time data and activity. What this means is that you’re completely online, and unbridled by the offline world that Excel has likely instilled in many professionals over the past decades. This also means that actions taken by members can update your contact list with recent activities such as event check-in, membership due alerts, late payments tags, and so on.

This means that not only is the staff who run the software updating contacts with relevant info, but members are also pitching in to update it as well by simply doing the activities they normally would without realizing it.

With cloud storage and usage, membership management software is able to save everything in a secure, backed up, and centralized list, in many cases called a CRM. This also allows the developer to deliver updates and bug-fixes periodically which improves user experience.
<h3>It offers user permission controls</h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16155 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Roles-and-Permissions.jpg"" alt=""membership roles and permissions"" width=""695"" height=""466"" />

With membership management software, you don’t have to worry about data privacy issues creeping up, at least, when it comes to your internal usage that is. It offers a more secure way for you to store your private information with little risk for leaks and unauthorized access.

With Excel, the security is as good as the device that it’s being used on, and it can be vulnerable after sharing to other users or just being on devices without decent security features.

But oftentimes there’s even unauthorized access to Excel files internal to an organization that Singaporean managers are oftentimes seeing as a big issue. With this in mind, membership management software offers the ability for organization managers to leverage user permissions to dictate roles among staff, thus reducing further the likely hood of data invalidation, copies, or even theft.
<h3>Only one version</h3>
Membership management software is by its virtue of being on the cloud and centrally accessed, the one and only version of any contact database that an organization needs.

There is no risk of copies being misplaced and spread around because there can and only ever will be one place to find that contact database.

With the master version being backed up and updated in real-time, it is even easier to make sub-lists by filtering contacts by certain traits, demographics, survey answers, and more. These lists exist temporarily, for any ad-hoc projects or campaigns, but no matter the situation, any changes made will be made to the master CRM list.
<h3>It’s mobile-friendly</h3>
Simply put, membership management software is mobile friendly. Software packages are usually paired with downloadable apps that are designed with mobile users in mind, and not just for yourself, but for your members and event attendees too.

That means actions are boiled down to easy buttons, touch-friendly, and sized perfectly for specific devices, all while collecting that very same data from real-life activities into the cloud.
<h2 id=""integrations"">Integration Options You Can't Get with Excel</h2>
Organizations thrive on more than just an excel sheet, but without proper data collection and hosting, bad or old data can spread to other tools too when you plug in your excel sheet.

For instance, what if contacts have left an organization? You know it already, but you’re using an outdated contact list because it’s a copy, living on a flash-drive that was in your bag. You probably didn’t even know it was old data, it just had the same name as the latest file, and you just went with it.

You plug it into your email marketing tool of choice, and now you’ve just sent the wrong email, to the wrong person.

This is where integrations benefit from being connected to your tools of choice in a more seamless fashion.
<h3>Event management</h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2775 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/EventBank-1024x622.png"" alt=""EventBank Event Management Software"" width=""1024"" height=""622"" />

Event Management is a great touch-point for members, and it can be crucial to collect and record engagement, or even more granularly, conversions from events that an organization may hold. In doing so it’s important to completely map out the member’s journey at the event from marketing, to registration, to check-in, until finally whether they convert or engage in an intended manner.

Excel sheets are a manual process as we’ve professed already in this piece, and with that means any actions taken at an event needs to be input manually.

Check-ins are easily enough done at the front door, and follow-up conversion recording can be done later. But can you identify who came from a marketing email? Who came from a social media post about the event? Who registered on a partner’s website and not yours?

Membership management software steps in to replace Excel as a completely real-time product that can remember which link that brought them to the event page, in-event survey questions that they answered, which event communities they joined and whether they later renewed their membership, or became a sponsor, and so on.

With this system in place, and mobile as a touch-point, features like QR code check-in, and member-tracking allow for a more insightful analysis of a user’s experience both at an event or at the organization in general.
<h3>Email marketing</h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-12227 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/vr-article-copy-65@2x-1024x549.png"" alt=""invitation email"" width=""1024"" height=""549"" />

Email marketing with membership management software allows you to engage members reliably, and when you have a healthy list, it can oftentimes be a successful endeavor. Again, this hearkens back to whether or not you do have a healthy list. On Excel, it’s hard to say for sure your list is as up to date as it could be.

But it’s not just about having a healthy list that makes email marketing a special, functional integration, but it’s also the ability to drill down target audiences from your lists into email lists (typically lists that cannot impact the main contact database but can be siphoned out of the main database for ad-hoc email campaigns).

Doing so, you can create lists for previous event attendees by filtering which members or contacts attended free events, paid events, or never attended any events. You can create lists of those members who are 20 days from losing their membership, so you can send them an email promotion with a discount to encourage them to stay.

This audience you have just drilled down further into is now ripe for the right content, and as long as your organization can recognize which content they’d like to hear, it’s realistic that email marketing integrations to your membership management software can become a core strategy in your renewals efforts or event management campaigns.

Singaporeans tend to <a href=""https://digitalinfluencelab.com/singapore-digital-marketing-stats/"">trust personal advertising </a>such as emails more than intrusive adverts. So, in order to make the email personal, you need to assess all the data gathered from your membership management software and discover what would really make it personal to them.

This allows for a more targeted marketing approach, making it a lot more successful than a general email that has no coordinated effort or specified audience to send to.

With data tracking, you will never lose a membership renewal again as you can set up automatic emails specific to members who are due their renewals as well, as most email marketing software has automated email features, that while basic, can trigger when a member is a week away from having their membership expire, and so could receive an automatic reminder.

Furthermore, hosting and promoting events just become easier because there's no import or export of lists to find the perfect email campaign target, you simply need to only filter for the right audiences, and the platform can target a list without disrupting the master contact database at all. And if you're looking to invite folks to an event, check out our list of <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/event-email-marketing-strategies/"">email invitation strategies</a> that just might do the trick for your next big event.

Any and all feedback from email campaigns also feed into the CRM so that you can look back in the past and see which contacts open, clicket, or ignored emails so you can gauge member or contact engagement with your organization.

Excel will never alert you or the member of their upcoming renewal date. Let that sink in for a moment.
<h3>Payment processing</h3>
When using Excel, your payments are not integrated. You will more than likely lose track of your payments, human errors will corrupt the data and time will be wasted.

With integrated tools to your membership management software, you’ll be able to invoice and process payments as you normally would with your preferred accounting tool, but now you’ll be able to feed payment details and actions to specific contacts in your member database, and use it to identify trends, problem areas, or develop lists for up-sell opportunities.

Combining your payment process with membership management software, will increase your payment security, save time and eliminate a large swath of human error incidents. It likewise makes the payment process less complicated for the purchaser, receipts can be issued, refunds can be given and the data will be automatically updated accordingly.
<h3>Better customer service</h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5914 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_7562-1024x683.jpg"" alt=""membership congregation"" width=""1024"" height=""683"" />

Organizations should always make sure they follow up with their consumers. Whether it's after a purchase, new membership or renewal. People value the time taken to reach out. With an embedded CRM, data tracking allows your organization to implement a more successful and meaningful customer service.

With Excel or other manual processes, you lose sight of this, or can otherwise spend time to manually record pertinent info. To people in Singapore, this is simply not acceptable behavior anymore and standards for customer service are under more and more consumer scrutiny.
<h3>Trust Us</h3>
We all know that Excel is comfortable and easy to use, and in Singapore, it can be often seen as a go-to tool. But with all the clear benefits provided using a dedicated membership management software, It may be time you and your organization made the move and start excelling without Excel.

We're also not saying you should give up Excel completely, Excel very much has functionality that's hard to find elsewhere, especially if you've updated to the latest versions where there are more reliable cloud and virtual copy auto-saving features that solve a lot of the issues we've talked about.

Legacy users will still very much have to contend with those challenges still, however.

But at the end of the day, your sheets shouldn't be your go-to lists for membership and contact management, so it's time to break out of those cells and into the new era of membership management.

16178,"2020's Five Best Airports & Airlines for Frequent Business Travelers","<p class=""x_MsoNormal"">2019 is ending and my major international business trips are done for the year as CEO of EventBank. This year, as we’ve been expanding EventBank’s global clientele list, opening new offices, and speaking or attending conferences, my mileage count this year is somewhere around 230,000 miles on various airlines and I’m about 50,000 miles away from 1 million miles on United (Star Alliance).</p>
<p class=""x_MsoNormal"">I’ve visited 5 continents, 19 countries and went through two more countries during a transfer. I have no doubt there are other business travelers that have visited more airports or flown on more airlines, but I figured I’d put my own rankings together with all those hours in airports and planes. Here we go:</p>

<h2 class=""x_MsoNormal"">Top 5 Airports</h2>
<ol start=""1"" type=""1"">
 	<li class=""x_MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst""><strong>Singapore Changi Airport (SIN)</strong> - No matter which terminal you land in or are leaving from, it’s always efficient, clean and there are plenty of options for good food. The most important aspect is because immigration and baggage claim are so efficient, you can get to your meeting within 30 to 40 minutes of landing. Oh, and the new terminal 4 is <em>amazing</em>.</li>
 	<li class=""x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle""><strong>Istanbul Airport (IST)</strong> - An amazing new airport ready to handle millions of new passengers.</li>
 	<li class=""x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle""><strong>Dubai International Airport (DXB)</strong> - 15 to 20 minutes from baggage claim to the hotel</li>
 	<li class=""x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle""><strong>Hamad International Airport, Qatar (DOH)</strong> - Great place for a long layover for transferring passengers. Nice food choices and plenty of shopping.</li>
 	<li class=""x_MsoListParagraphCxSpLast""><strong>Hong Kong International Airport (HKT)</strong> - In town check in, with efficient immigration. Good food choices (yes, they have Popeyes!). It would be ranked much higher, but too many delays due to “China air space congestion”.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class=""x_MsoNormal"">Most Inconvenient Airport</h3>
<p class=""x_MsoNormal""><strong>Beijing Capital International Airport (PEK)</strong></p>
<p class=""x_MsoNormal"">An amazing architectural design, but for business travelers just a bad place to come in and out of. If you check a bag, you might have to wait up to an hour and a half for them to arrive. The food in the international terminal has fewer choices than a small airport in Mozambique. If you arrived at the wrong time with a bunch of other planes, the “foreigner” immigration line could be a <strong>couple of hours</strong>.</p>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16183 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/immigration-line.jpg"" alt=""china peking airport immigration wait"" width=""814"" height=""525"" />
<p class=""x_MsoNormal"">And worst of all, if you want to get out of the airport, good luck. Because they closed the entire “arrivals” area that the airport was designed for, which makes trying to find your Didi (Chinese Uber) driver not a fun game after a 13-hour flight. He (or she) is either being chased by the police as they try to pick you up in the Departure driveway or having to wait in the bottom of the parking garage on either the east or west side (roll the dice). Average about 2 hours and 15 minutes to get to your meeting or hotel from landing.</p>
<p class=""x_MsoNormal"">We’re still a growing company, so I only fly economy. So, the experience on some of these airlines is probably different for those sitting in upper-class seating.</p>

<h2 class=""x_MsoNormal"">Top 5 Airlines</h2>
<ol start=""1"" type=""1"">
 	<li class=""x_MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst""><strong>Singapore Airlines</strong>- The hardest working flight attendants in the industry. Good service and always a smile. An excellent entertainment system with many international choices and airplane food that you can say was good.</li>
 	<li class=""x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle""><strong>Emirates</strong>- Flying the A380 is always an experience at takeoff, so smooth for such a massive airplane. The best entertainment system on an airline with free wifi/tv and a well-trained team.</li>
 	<li class=""x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle""><strong>Cathay Pacific</strong>- Friendly service, good drinks, and comfortable seats.</li>
 	<li class=""x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle""><strong>Turkish Airlines</strong>- Great branding and commercials. Well rounded from the team to the food to the entertainment system.</li>
 	<li class=""x_MsoListParagraphCxSpLast""><strong>Qatar Airways</strong>- Comfortable airplanes and good food. (I didn’t fly enough to rank higher than others).</li>
</ol>
<h3 class=""x_MsoNormal"">Best Airline Business Lounge</h3>
<p class=""x_MsoNormal""><strong>Turkish Airlines </strong></p>
<p class=""x_MsoNormal"">This lounge has some of the best food and drinks you will find anywhere. An amazing and diverse selection of food and doesn’t feel overcrowded if there are a lot of people traveling through. I always look forward to some time there.</p>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16184 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Turkish-Airlines-Lounge-Istanbul-1750px-4.jpg"" alt=""turkish airlines lounge rank"" width=""1620"" height=""1080"" />
<h3 class=""x_MsoNormal"">Most Improved Airline</h3>
<p class=""x_MsoNormal""><strong>Air China</strong></p>
<p class=""x_MsoNormal"">I have been flying Air China for many years and absolutely dreaded it. But, over the past couple of years, their service has improved significantly and their airplanes are more comfortable. It has been a noticeable difference.</p>

<h3 class=""x_MsoNormal"">Worst Frequent Flyer Program</h3>
<p class=""x_MsoNormal""><strong>United</strong></p>
<p class=""x_MsoNormal"">I fly on United so often and spent countless hours on their new Dreamliners (which are great), but they keep changing their program and making it more and more difficult every year to obtain status.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class=""x_MsoNormal"">Note: These rankings are by no means scientific or compiled by a judging panel, they were compiled through many trips around the globe by one person. Not every country was visited and not every airline way flown.</p>
</blockquote>

16273,"7 Steps to Crafting Your Ideal Membership Welcome Package this 2020","Membership strategies are as much about the follow-up as they are with the lead-in, and with more and more organizations going digital with membership management. We decided this would be a great chance to come with some welcome package offers that engage and satisfy your new members. By doing so you increase the chances of expanding your membership through referrals, and exciting members to enough to renew their memberships later.
<h3>Jump to an Idea</h3>

<a href=""#referral"">Referral Programs</a>
<h2 id=""top"">Organizations are going digital</h2>
By leveraging <a href=""//get.eventbank.com/membership-management-software"">membership management software</a> membership-based organizations like associations, chambers, and clubs can now take all of their traditional methods of membership registration, on-boarding, and engagement to a cloud platform that's easy and simple to use. This helps save on the time-cost of dealing with physical paperwork and manual actions like email promotions, event management, and membership renewal notifications.

It's with this new tech that organizations can now offer more benefits, and that also includes introducing some digital goodies to their usual welcome packages. We've got some great ideas to welcome your new members, check it out!
<h2 id=""email"">Welcome Email</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3293 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Email-Campaigns-Ad-white@2x.png"" alt=""membership welcome package"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Welcome Emails are a must-have and a no-brainer. Registration processes are the absolute first item on the menu that gets digitized, and it helps feed your list of contacts, in this case, members. Once you have their email and name, it's the perfect time to immediately shoot them an email.

What should be in this email? Absolutely everything they need!

Your welcome email should make your members feel welcome of course, but it should also act as a jumping-off point for members to know what their membership entails in a summary, and offer resources that get them started. It should also point them in a direction they might be interested in.

For instance, a cricket club just got a new member, and he's received the welcome email automatically. The ideal welcome emails should be welcoming, and then provides directly the resources he needs to get started or links to the sources online. This could be instructions on how to rent equipment, schedule of events or open field time, cost of uniforms and clothing, and so on. Among that there should also be a way to push members to be active from the get-go. In this case of a cricket club, it would be an offer for new players to attend a training session, which instantly gets new members engaged.

Depending on the formality of an organization, the welcome letter might come physically as a sign of quality gratitude, but this still doesn't remove the necessity of digital email deliveries, as it's a great way to keep track of user engagement. A physical letter can be lost, but an email can be found for the foreseeable future.
<h2 id=""cards"">Membership Cards</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5403 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-2.png"" alt=""virtual membership card"" width=""600"" height=""600"" />

Membership cards hold a special place in everyone's hearts. It gives the feeling to a member that they hold the key to something important, and it makes them feel exclusive. This should be the second, but equally important function of any welcome package.

Membership cards are not just a symbol of exclusivity either. They're also a functional engagement tool that helps members unlock access to areas of facilities, gain discounts, check in at events, and more.

Depending on the scale, or size of membership markets in an organization, supplying physical cards can be a costly endeavor, and wouldn't you believe it, they're going digital too! How? Membership management software like here at EventBank, are developing membership cards within smartphone apps that function as a physical card does. This means it can be used to check into events, get discounts, scan and more.
<h2 id=""gifts"">Gifts, coupons, and other swag</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3149 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/swag-bag@2x.png"" alt=""swag bag ideas"" width=""1920"" height=""1003"" />

Of course, who doesn't like a free gift? It's one of the easiest ways to immediately satisfy a new member and helps to make them feel valued. Gifts can come both physically and digitally too. The most common digital gifts are simply discount codes, or a certain amount of discounts or rebate applied to the member's account with the organizations.

These gifts could arrive in the welcome packet, or at a later time. You can also set up membership goals that let periodic gifts get delivered to members who achieve certain criteria, or just to entice them to stay a member longer. We believe criteria goals are better than time goals as a great technique to use if member turnover is high in an organization. Criteria goals encourage participation and engagement which is the key to reducing turnover. Gyms are a great example of this, where members who complete a certain routine at the gym can earn gifts like vouchers, water bottles, and more. Whereas professional organizations would reward members who attend events often with items relevant to the industry or cause.

Of course, if the items are physical, make sure they follow 2 great criteria: They're <b>permanent</b> <i>and</i> <b>branded</b>. Don't brand paper cups to give out if they're just going to end up in the trash, and don't give out steel thermoses if they're not branded. For most members, small trinkets give temporary satisfaction, so branding needs to carry on in order to provide long term recognizable impact and helps to spread your organization's name around. Like in our <a href=""//blog.eventbank.com/swag-bag-ideas/"">Swag Bag article</a>, we talk about how items can help improve the user experience by adding QR codes that give awesome benefits back.
<h2 id=""guest"">Guest Passes</h2>
Guest passes are quite an easy giveaway, and it's quite a great way to leverage your current members into becoming spokespersons bringing new prospect members to your organization's events and facilities. Delivering these guest passes can be both physical or digital, and there can always be a structure of how the guest passes work.

For example, you could limit guest passes to:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Single-Use</strong>: A single guest pass for access to Events, or one-day access to facilities.</li>
 	<li><strong>Monthly Usage</strong>: A member can bring a guest to 1 event or enter facilities once per week/month.</li>
 	<li><strong>Unlimited Use</strong>: Guests can access events and facilities so long as they are with the member who invited them.</li>
</ul>
These strategies are great because it helps encourage new and fresh faces to enjoy your organization's events, services, or facilities, and is very likely a high converting part of any organization's strategy.

<h2>New Member Discounts</h2>
<img class=""wp-image-5406 size-full"" src=""//blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/add-on-woocommerce-member-discounts-771x386.png"" alt=""Membership Discount"" width=""771"" height=""386"" />

New members are pretty curious about your offers once they join, and prices could be the barrier that keeps them from fully engaging from Day-1 of their onboarding as a member. It's a phenomenal idea to offer new member discounts that last enough time to make them consider purchasing other items or services you offer. This is also a great chance to leverage new member discounts into partnerships with other third party businesses so that you can provide further value outside your organization's walls.

Typically new member discounts should last 1-3 months, and the discounts should be in-line with your strategy. Discounts can also come with free trials of other services, like renting sports gear for instance or offering 1 free meal. This could also be considered as part of the freebies given away in the first email delivery as we said earlier.

The strategy is all about providing early on offers with as little barrier as possible. A member who enjoys meals at your facilities might love your food. But if a new member might potentially stay as a member for this meals, but is not given a discount in their onboarding as a new member, they may actually skip this offering since they just spent money on a membership. These discounts offer less of a cost barrier that gets members engaged early on, and lets them explore enough about their new membership that makes them latch on and stay a member even longer.

It's an easy gesture and it goes a long way to help new members feel welcome. Throw a monthly event just for new members so they don't feel overwhelmed with your normal events which, at times, can be quite overwhelming if your organization has a lot of moving parts.

For instance, if you run an organization about a certain programming language and you want to encourage new coders to join, a welcome event is a great way to introduce them to your organization's methodologies, events they can expect, and some training.

If your organization is centered around a physical location like a sports club or gym, then maybe there's a need for a tour around the campus. Think of it like orientation. This can make them feel welcome, but more importantly, it gets them up to speed and ready to jump into more intricate activities in your organization's near future.
<h2 id=""referral"">Referral Program</h2>
Tying this in with the Guest passes, you can incentivize your members to bring in others to check out the organization's events. By creating referral programs, you enhance the effectiveness and the longevity of members by offering perks, more gifts, discounts, or premium access to members who can sign up a referral that they bring.

This is a very, very common tactic that seems to work in most cases. Great setups like getting a discount for both the current and the new member will encourage the current member to stay longer and refer more future members, and the new member will feel extra special that they got a discount or reward of some kind.

Here are some cool referral program strategies to consider putting into your program.
<ul>
 	<li><b>X% off for You &amp; Your Referral</b> or <b>Receive this awesome gift for referring a new member!</b></li>
 	<li><b>X% off on your next membership renewal.</b></li>
 	<li><b>Refer X amount of new members and get this amazing gift/discount!</b></li>
</ul>
There's plenty of other creative ways to craft a referral program, but most of all, it's important to know which one reaches out to your members.

<strong>P.S.</strong> you can stretch these programs out to include rewards after a certain period of time if the referral member renews. So, for instance, if someone brought in a referral to become a member, and a year later they renew, you can go back and reward the original member who introduced them. It's a great way to make the referral program strategy into a long term one.
<h2>Over to You</h2>
It's incredibly lucrative to leverage welcome packages into a long term engagement strategy that keeps member renewing their memberships and bringing in new, fresh faces to your organization. What we have here is a compiled list of great ideas to use. You can use one, or two, or all of them, as they're all meant to give back early value and satisfaction that can help your organization grow.

There's more to managing your members than just giving them a warm welcome. They crave engagement, and one of the best ways is to keep them in the loop on your organization's events, activities, and news. What better way than to give your organization a mobile app that keeps your member up to date on real-time communication, promotion, and events with the EventBank App. <b><a href=""//get.eventbank.com/membership-management-software"">Book a Demo</a></b> and we'll show you how you can turn your organization into the digital space and give your members the engagement they crave.

16276,"Marketing Predictions for 2020: Here’s What the Experts Say","Reinventing through digital transformation. Enhancing customer experience. Next-level personalization. Increasing data and privacy regulations. That’s just some of the marketing challenges we’ve encountered over the past year.

But to succeed in marketing, you always need to be forward-thinking. This means being always in-the-know of the next big thing, the latest advancements, and all the trends that are sure to be big over the next 12 months.

As we look to a new decade, what are the opportunities you need to seize? Here’s what the other marketers have to say will be the biggest marketing opportunity this 2020.
<h3>The Rise of AI</h3>
<blockquote><em>AI will play a big role in 2020 --- from virtual customer assistants to AI driven marketing campaigns. Data will be the oil to AI, and marketers will find themselves challenging existing systems and technologies in search of refined, actionable data. KPI's will evolve, and so will Marketers --- it will be an exciting, challenging year!</em>

<h3>Data-driven Advertising</h3>
<blockquote><em>It's contextual and data-driven advertising towards pushing consumers online (e-commerce) or offline (brick &amp; mortar stores) to consider/purchase goods-- letting consumers choose. There's no reason for brands to go blanket on their communication approach, especially with many avenues and available data for marketers to do relevant ads today. I'm sure brands will also continue to find ways to grow their own database, aligned with data privacy act.</em>

<h3>Sales Coach in the Form of Bot</h3>
<blockquote><em>In B2B marketing, personal interactions will continue to be important. Capturing, synthesizing, and drawing insights from these interactions are critical in order to make sound decisions. A Sales Coach in a form of an intelligent conversational agent have the potential to do this, the bot will serve as a sales coach to the seller, which will make it seamless for the sellers to deliver messages, collect data, and synthesize the data into meaningful insights. This will ensure that marketing has accurate and real-time views on the customer interactions and recommend next steps.</em>

<h3>Marketers Shall Rely Not Only on Data But Actionable Insights</h3>
<blockquote><em>As a professional in the Media Data industry, I foresee more and more marketers relying not only on data but also on Actionable Insights. Digital marketers will go beyond social media engagement statistics and look into more measures like customer affinity and company reputation to be more competitive. The trend of using social media for marketing will continue but marketers will be smart in measuring the performance, to craft better content and strategy and to ensure engagement of the digital public and customers.</em>

<h3>Transient Content Will Only Get More Popular</h3>
<blockquote><em>Transient content refers to something available only for a short while, like for example Instagram Stories, Snapchat, and the less popular but still used Facebook and Youtube Stories. With everyone’s attention spans getting shorter and shorter, the way we consume content is also changing. Since its introduction in 2016, the number of Daily Active Users on Instagram Story has quintupled, from its original 100 million to a current whopping 500 million. Why is it so popular? Transient content tends to feel a lot more authentic, with users sharing their thoughts and information on the fly. It’s easy to use and engaging, and helps us consume information so much faster than we were previously able to.</em>

<h3>Messaging Apps as Customer Service</h3>
<blockquote><em>Brands will use messaging apps like WhatsApp, Viber, Facebook Messenger, Twitter and Instagram, to be more personal, authentic and build stronger connections with customers. Direct messaging will be used to streamline customer service and assist sales in 2020. These forums offer the convenience of text with the speediness of a phone conversation, as if the customer is talking to a friend.</em>

<h3>Rise of All-in-One Event Mobile Apps</h3>
<blockquote>Mobile continues winning the attention of people worldwide and event planners know that a mobile app is a must-have to maximize engagement throughout the event cycle. But 2020 will mark the end of one-time use event apps that get uninstalled as soon as the event is over. Instead we will see “disposable” event apps disappearing as event organizers move to all-in-one event apps with a holistic approach that will provide attendees with more value - access to all events, newsletters, important news and more.

16324,"How Indonesia Can Deliver Value to Members with Software","EventBank hosts events across the globe so that we can engage association and chamber of commerce professionals, and find out what truly challenges them. Recently we held one such event in Jakarta, Indonesia and discovered what makes it such an up-start associations market.

Indonesian associations are considered to be both successful and optimistic. However, they are somewhat lagging behind when it comes to embracing new technologies and creating member experiences. But adding value to your members doesn’t have to be such a struggle. It should be effortless and it can be! Digital technologies offer a way for you to boost membership value.

Indonesia is moving at its own pace; but with the world's 4th largest population, it exerts so much potential and is fully recognized as a powerful country. First, though, it is necessary for them to innovate and embrace technology. This will require associations to step up to the challenge and say yes to transforming themselves.

So, are you ready?
<h2>Importance of Memberships</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16337 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSCF0130.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1620"" height=""1080"" />

Do associations really need members? Couldn't it be easier just to go member-less, be open to the public, and just get the ROI from other areas like events and partnerships?

Well, yes, and here's why: <strong>Members are the value of your organization</strong>. It creates a sense of community and members will often time bring value back to the organization in other ways, meaning there is always room to grow and having good member relationships is a good way to spread positive word of mouth. Too, members keep you on your toes! You have to keep engaging them, updating social media and providing meaningful reasons to stay, which only goes to improve the experience of being a member in the long run.

Memberships exist to benefit everyone involved. Association memberships provide a place for people to network and hopefully grow in some way. They encourage links and meaningful connections, some might even say they have become crucial to a person's professional success.

So why then, are the Gen Z and millennials not joining associations?
<h2>Indonesian Association’s Challenges</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16334 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSCF0095.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1620"" height=""1080"" />

Sadly everyday businesses are losing grip of millennials. They are simply failing to keep up and are not adding enough value to make them stay. This is something Indonesian associations are really struggling with, not only because they are not tapping into the use of technology but often due to the financial restraints preventing many from making the investment.

Indonesia is growing at a<a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Locations/Asia/Indonesia/Our Insights/Unlocking Indonesias digital opportunity/Unlocking_Indonesias_digital_opportunity.ashx""> rapid pace</a> but is still constrained by limited access to technology and a lack of technological know-how.

If they fail to keep up, retain and find new members, they could risk losing their business.
<h3>Low Membership Retention</h3>
Having a high membership retention rate is crucial to an organization's long-term success. It costs <a href=""https://www.themembershipguys.com/member-retention-tips/"">7-10 times</a> more on average to attract a new member than it does to actually hold on to an existing one; so if you are losing more members than you are gaining, you need to act fast.

This can be done by adding value to your members making them more engaged. Getting your members more involved through social media, connecting them via networking events or simply providing them with more personalized and relatable content.
<h3>Lack of Data</h3>
If you as a company are not leveraging the latest technology in Indonesia, it is likely that you are unable to track and access as much data as your competitors. But, having membership information is vital if you are to increase your engagement rate and entice new members.

So, now is the time to change. Associations need to start embracing new technological change and incorporating analytics into their decisions. Tracking and analyzing data will not only help you to make smarter business decisions but it will keep your members happy with a more valuable experience.
<h3>Lifetime Payments</h3>
Offering lifetime memberships seem like a good idea at the time, but is it really a long term solution to your temporary cash flow problems?

No, this really is not a good idea and is often a reoccurring issue among Indonesian associations. Members may change careers, be no longer engaged or simply not want to be part of your organization anymore and it’s important to remember that offering a lifetime membership payment will not keep them.

This kind of quick fix strategy should not be used to try and increase ROI. Managing your new members, hosting events and spending money promoting social media campaigns is all going cost your association. So, yes it is a tempting idea to try and increase your current revenue by drawing in lifetime members, but there are background costs and additional time that must be spent on these members; and costs will often increase more than your association was perhaps prepared for.
<h3>Misuse of Technology</h3>
One major association issue in Indonesia is that they are not using their existing technology enough in order to fully enjoy the benefits. Most don’t have enough time or money to be wasting on membership tracking or analytics but utilizing technology to your advantage doesn't have to be so much of exclusive luxury. Besides, if your business doesn’t start to adapt, you risk a huge loss in revenue and members.

Therefore, it is important to embrace the idea of using technology as a way of not only adding value to your members but increasing your overall revenue. It is a shame to see some associations social media platforms not being utilized in a more engaging manner as it is so easy to do and can be done without costing your association any extra cash - you just need a creative thinker and 10 minutes to spare.
<h2>CRM and Optimization</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16336 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSCF0114.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1620"" height=""1080"" />

CRM is all about the future. It is for associations who are ready to enter a whole new era of<a href=""https://selecthub.com/customer-relationship-management/future-of-crm/""> intelligence</a>. Implementing CRM software not only makes your life a lot easier but it offers effortless membership experiences.
CRM opens your association up to a world of possibilities. It allows you to first have all of your membership information in one place, meaning that CRM will input all the relevant information to give you a better understanding of who your members really are. It allows you to track them and plan your marketing according.

Adding CRM to other tools is extremely effective also. It can be used in connection with email marketing. Once you have established what attracts a member to open or attend an event you can target your campaigns and events accordingly. They will feel involved and appreciated as you took the time to personalize the email. Likewise, CRM leaves room for better customer service. Members can get in touch with someone in real-time and this is something that is very important to the millennial generation.

People value being valued and members will most definitely appreciate a member welcome email. But, don’t forget to check up on your loyal members also, sending a thank you email once in a while can be extremely effective at keeping retention high.
<h2>Social Media</h2>
Although Indonesia might be a little later when it comes to joining the social media party. It doesn’t have to mean that it can’t still be as effective. Social media is a great way to keep members digitally engaged which is so important in the new tech-savvy era.

The most popular social media platforms in Indonesia right now are; <a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/284437/indonesia-social-network-penetration/"">Youtube with 88%</a> using it. 83% of people in Indonesia are using WhatsApp, 80-81% using Facebook and Instagram. With only 52% and 33% using Twitter and LinkedIn. Here are a few ways to target members using these platforms.
<h3>Micro Content</h3>
The average reader’s attention span <a href=""http://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/"">is 8 seconds</a>, which means if people don’t like what they see they won’t stay interested for long. So how do you engage members within 8 seconds?

You target your members firstly by using the personal membership data you previously obtained via tracking and analyzing your analytics in CRM. Then, try your best to understand your members, figure out what they might like reading about or do they watch more videos than read articles? This can allow you to create social media content that they are actually interested in. Since Youtube is the biggest platform in Indonesia it can be assumed that they prefer video content. So, then just make it more appealing, more targeted and relatable. It is that easy.

Too, remember then to share your Youtube videos on Facebook and Instagram to grow your traffic. Facebook and Instagram now allow you to add stories. These are perfect for micro-content as they are only 15 seconds long. So, add little snippets of your day, tips or daily motivation videos here. Likewise, on Facebook start live videos, stream your association's events and present Q+As on Facebook.
<h3>Sense of Community</h3>
Building a sense of community through social media is not only an excellent way to draw traffic to your website but it keeps members super engaged. They like to feel apart of something and they enjoy embracing their connections online. So, encourage conversations online by posting a video or picture while asking a question to start a debate. This will be sure to raise brand awareness and create a strong, loyal community of members.
<h2>Membership Tracking</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16338 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DSCF0138.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1620"" height=""1080"" />

Understanding your members is a key advantage. As you can see from the points tackled above, in order to optimize social media, engage members and gain new ones you need to know and understand your members. It enables you to pull everything together and get the most out of technology.

You can access your analytics data on social media posts and interactions. This can help you decide who is interested in what, what time is best to post new content and events as well as what new trends people might be following. Then, with the new data created using CRM you are able to have a better insight into who your members really are and how can you best keep them happy.

Another way to do gain a better insight into your members would be by creating a new membership survey as well as an exit survey. Most firms tend to forget that this can be an extremely useful piece of information. This allows you to get a better understanding of the new members and see what it is that they expect to gain from the membership.

Too, an exit survey can be used to help improve the company’s bottom line in an attempt to decrease retention and the associated costs of membership.
<h2>Tackling Security Concerns</h2>
<a href=""https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/publication/documents/2019-09/ipsos-flair-indonesia-2019.pdf"">72%</a> of people in Indonesia have high privacy concerns. 95% agree that this concern is mostly due to cybercriminals and most fear sharing their data online. As a result, your association needs to make members feel safe sharing their data with you. If a member does not trust your association is protecting their information, they will leave and the word of mouth that can spread from one concerned member will turn into a mass amount. So be careful with member data and protect it as much as they expect you too.

CRM allows you to put restrictions on your member's private information so it can’t be viewed by just anyone. This is important to protect and ensure a tight restriction and a limited number of users have access. Too, instill a safe and respectful culture within the organization and have competent employees operating the cloud systems.

So, as a result. If Indonesian associations want to keep up and add value to their members, technology is the way forward, even if that means shaking up your organization’s every-day activities and engagement strategy. To learn more about how your organization can start benefiting from membership software, book a demo today, and we'll show you how EventBank can do just that.

16329,"Thailand's Organizations are Using the Right Software in the Wrong Direction","<a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/advertorial/2018/06/18/how-thailand-is-bringing-technology-to-the-table.html"">Thailand 's </a>organization scene are quick adapters to business software like CRMs, Email Marketing Tools, and partnering left and right with tech-driven agencies. They are equipped with the best software, the best management processes and are highly innovative. However, with all these software adoptions, there is a seemingly big piece of the puzzle missing.

They’re communicating, analyzing data, and spotting trends, but they’re oftentimes not targeting membership growth as their core growth area. This can oftentimes be attributed to the fact that members crave a personalized experience, and this personalized communication can cost organizations time and effort, while also being difficult to scale up.

An organization with 100 members is relatively easy to manage and engage with, but an organization with 1000 members will find it difficult to make ever member feel special and welcome. This is where technology needs to be invested in, most especially in Thailand where tech-fluent organizations are using software, but in the wrong direction.

So let's dive in and see how organizations can scale their growth without sacrificing personalized member engagement.
<h2>The Right Software in the Wrong Direction</h2>
Membership retention is a major issue for organizations in Thailand, people are becoming disengaged and often forgotten about due to the lack of direction and focus on members. So, if your association has seen a lack of new sign-ups or is losing members quickly, something needs to change. Members want to feel valued and like they are part of the team. They want to be informed of new events and experience VIP treatment when they become a member. Wouldn’t you?

So it has to be said that yes, Thai organizations are using tech in a highly effective way. But they are going in a less-than-optimal direction. The technology that you might be using makes your internal processes easier and even smarter, sure, but if it’s not helping you target the core needs of members, then it will have a less than ideal impact on your organization's growth.
<h2>The Way Forward</h2>
Delivering value to members is easy, especially as Thai companies are already using the best tech. You just need to use it in the right way and find the best alternative so that it can benefit both you and your members. It doesn’t have to be time consuming or overwhelming.

Here’s a few ways how you can start tackling the issue:
<h3>Membership Apps</h3>
<img class=""wp-image-16372 size-large aligncenter"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/saveyourchamber-5@2x-1024x829.png"" alt="""" width=""1024"" height=""829"" />

With <a href=""https://appsynth.net/blog/thailands-top-apps/"">71%</a> of Thais now using a smartphone, apps have changed the way Thai people think and interact with businesses and engage with their surroundings. The top businesses all around the world are treating mobile apps as a key strategic initiative, as the best-in-class apps are now proving to be a huge success. And creating a membership app might just be the way to get your firm to the top.

Creating a membership app is a huge step in the right direction for Thai companies. It is a great way for the organization to keep in touch with their members. It allows you to send them messages, update them on news, purchase tickets and browse your latest events wherever they are; all in one app. This is a very powerful tool, as membership apps are definitely the way forward. Everyone is using them and milllenials love the idea of having everything on their phone at the touch of a button. So keep up.

So it is time for you to put your tech to the test and create an app that will help keep your members engaged and feel fully valued. They will believe they are fully connected to you and your business.
<h3>Events</h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1528 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/check-in-2-phones.jpg"" alt=""mobile check-in, event ROI"" width=""1620"" height=""1080"" />

Hosting events and holding the information digitally for members to access is an extremely successful way to get a good ROI, while also delivering value to your members.

Having your event information and ticket registration all on one page is not only a good way to keep everything together but it makes the process a lot smoother for members and less hassle. So more are likely to actually sign up and visit your site. This could even be an idea that could be put onto your app, it makes the process even better. Members should be able to visit your member app, browse events and get tickets all in one sitting. This is extremely convenient and with the software available in Thailand, it is a new way forward as the upcoming generation now expects more convenience and ease as possible.

However, it is important to remember. The Thai consumers are impulse buyers, they don’t hesitate to buy and only want the best. Their income is <a href=""https://santandertrade.com/en/portal/analyse-markets/thailand/reaching-the-consumers"">rising </a>and so are their demands, so Thai consumers want more than an event or an app; they want an experience.
<h3>Automation and Communication</h3>
<img class=""notfull alignnone wp-image-16373 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/saveyourchamber-14@2x.png"" alt="""" width=""386"" height=""278"" />

Thai organizations have a major advantage when it comes to automation and communication. Due to the fact that they are so up to date with their software, they are already working towards this. However, they just need a little push in order to make sure it is being used to deliver value to members.

Thai organizations should be creating a list of each different target audience to make it a lot easier, to one, target them but also so that they can make it more personal for the members. They can then use this list to send personalized push notifications and marketing emails. Although, one thing to remember is that reaching your target audience can be challenging enough but Thailand has so many <a href=""http://www.midas-pr.com/integrated-communications-necessary-success-thailand/"">foreign</a> companies and consumers. This means they will need to adapt and communicate to consumers in their local language to make it that little bit more personal and help you reach a larger audience.

Software can be used to help them automate their membership renewal reminders to members based on a certain amount of time before their membership expires. This is an extremely important feature to have, as most firms lose track and therefore lose out on so many renewals simply because they didn’t know. Making this manual process into an automated one so that they can keep more members renewing without lifting a finger, which is always a major win-win.
<h3><b>Social Media Trends</b></h3>

Personalization is the best way to keep members engaged. They want to be receiving content that is related to them on a regular basis. One way to do this is by using social media to reach them and adding micro-content. In Thailand Facebook and YouTube seem to have the biggest number of active users with Facebook on<a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/284483/thailand-social-network-penetration/""> 93% </a>and YouTube at 91%, but with a noticeable downward shift in past months on Facebook, with Youtube climbing up slowly as <a href=""http://internet.nectec.or.th/webstats/bandwidth.iir?Sec=bandwidth"">faster internet packages</a> are being served to customers in Thailand in recent years that can support higher quality video streaming and increasing demand for YouTube content searches.

So use this to your advantage and post regular videos on YouTube. Share them on Facebook and get the online conversation going, keep them active and engaged by asking questions and getting them to interact. This type of online communication could help open up the idea of an online community for your members. Somewhere they can feel a sense of togetherness and engage over personal interests. Line and Instagram are also continuing to rise with Line at 84% and Instagram at 65%.

2020 is a big year for micro and video content as <a href=""https://appsynth.net/blog/thailands-top-apps/"">51%</a> of Thais report watching videos on their smartphone daily and 81% at least once per week. So stick close to these and find time to make this a daily ritual. Then, if members like what they see, viewing your page every day will become a routine for them.

It is important, however, when using social media to engage members; you cannot lose focus. You have to be updated regularly, targeting the content well and doing your best to keep the conversation going. Give members a reason to stay and click on your page. Provide them with exclusive events and post events on social media, stream seminars exclusively for your followers and offer event discounts to members.
<h3><b>CRM</b></h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1525 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/crm@2x.png"" alt=""CRM, event ROI"" width=""880"" height=""846"" />

Having everything in one place is always a good idea. Using CRM is a way for you to input all your membership data into one place and it is so easy to read. You will be able to distinguish between a new and an older member targeting them with emails and event information accordingly.

Likewise, it makes the operations of the event run a lot more smoothly as it tracks things like who has paid already from who is not likely to show up. This kind of data will be invaluable to you in the future when it comes to marketing and who might need a little more attention.

A lot easier for you as a business. CRM allows everyone to edit the one file and have access to it wherever they are. It also allows for restrictions to be put on the file so if there is people you perhaps don’t feel need access to certain sensitive data, you simply restrict them. It is also so easy and very worthwhile.
<h3><b>Use Your Tech in the Right Way </b></h3>
Thailand is surging with technology at this moment in time. It is using technology in genius ways to transform business processes but that isn’t always a reason for members to stay with your or for new ones to sign up.
<a href=""https://santandertrade.com/en/portal/analyse-markets/thailand/reaching-the-consumers"">40%</a> of consumers' purchases were digitally influenced, meaning if Thai firms do not make their online presence valuable, they could be missing a whole different market of members.

So, use your software and social media to discover more about your members, track what they like and what they don’t like.
Find the analytics that can help you best personalize each member's experience and use this data to your advantage.

Create membership surveys to help find out more about what they want out of the relationship and even create one for when members decide to leave.

So, yes you might have the best software and your back-end management processes are working like clockwork. But, members want more, they want to have an experience and feel like they are in a partnership with you.

16403,"5 Benefits to Using Digital Membership Cards","<h2>What’s a Digital Membership Card?</h2>
Like a physical membership card, a digital membership card reflects the owner’s belonging to an organization or program and allows certain benefits or perks through the card’s use. Whether it’s unlocking doors, easy check-in at events, or getting discounts and participating retailers and restaurants, a digital membership card can do all these things <i>and more</i>.

Larger companies like Costco and <a href=""https://www.lanecrawford.com.hk/info/help/help-and-info/membership/digital-membership-card/"">LaneCrawford</a> have been first-movers, developing their own digital membership cards in-house to serve customers. But now, as tools in the SaaS world get cheaper and more accessible, your organization can be adopting this tech too and start delivering smarter, digital membership cards.
<h2>Physical Vs. Digital Cards</h2>
Digital and Physical membership cards, from a bird’s eye view, look like they can operate in the same fashion. There are some very obvious, or not so obvious differences, but let’s quickly go over how they’re similar, and then we’ll get into the nitty-gritty about why you should be using digital membership cards at your organization.
<h3>Physical Membership Cards</h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16411 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MembershipCard.png"" alt=""physical membership card"" width=""1843"" height=""1354"" />

Looking at traditional physical membership cards, those plastic pieces hold a fairly standard set of 2 interactivity methods which are a code of some kind like a bar or QR code, and also a magnetic strip or chip that holds a wavelength that can be translated into an ID number belonging to the cardholder.

This means that the card can be used to identify the cardholder when they use the card at checking, unlocking doors, or otherwise using the card anywhere that the card’s information can be captured.
<h3>Digital Membership Cards</h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16372 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/saveyourchamber-5@2x.png"" alt=""digital membership cards"" width=""1406"" height=""1138"" />

Digital membership cards operate in the same fashion as a physical card in that being digital, and with the extreme adoption rates of smartphones, they exist on someone’s person at all times, potentially even more so than a physical card. These digital cards no longer need magnetic strips or codes but rather can leverage the on-board technology of the device it exists on.

This expands its usage but can be drilled down to photographic, IR, QR, Bar Codes, Fingerprint, and Facial Recognition. Boiled down, however, all touch-points a physical membership card can do, so can a digital card with the aforementioned technologies on-board your smartphone.
<h2>Here’s the Benefits</h2>
<h3>1. All the same features of a physical card (and more)</h3>
Digital Membership cards leverage technology on your phone. That means there’s far more flexibility on how the device can be used, and without sacrificing any features of a physical card. Doors can be unlocked by scanning a code or recognizing the IR code that’s on the device.

Discounts arranged with retailers mean clerks can scan a QR or Bar code on your member’s digital membership card to use discounts via the membership terms, and so on.
<h3>2. Higher Level of Security</h3>
Furthermore, you can use double-authentication to ensure a phone simply wasn’t stolen like a physical card can be, and used accordingly to access anything provided by your organization. Should a member want to access an event, maybe you can activate fingerprint scanning from their phone to ensure the card can be brought on screen for event check-in scanning, and if the phone was stolen, simply cancel the member’s login session on that device, and wait for a new device to be detected and authorized by the member.
<h3>3. Easier Card Management</h3>
What isn’t standard is the organization’s side of things. The ability to deliver or revoke membership cards with a few clicks on the software’s back-end gives more power to the organization and far more security in the delivery of access, perks, and benefits.

This also makes it much easier to make on-the-fly changes to a member’s level of benefits and access, so that when members upgrade their membership, earned new perks, or otherwise forgot to renew their membership, it can be quite easy to change at any particular time, or even automatically revoke access to members who don’t renew.

This also means that it’s easier to manage member access if your organization has multiple far-flung locations across the country or even the world, as one location using the back-end can easily manage members no matter where they are.
<h3>4. It’s Greener</h3>
What this means is that it takes much less time and effort necessary to collect physical cards, issue new cards, or otherwise manage them. It’s also much cost-effective and green for the environment when you no longer have to print or throw away plastics for physical cards. This doesn’t even change the behavior of using physical cards too, as they still slip snug into a member’s pocket, so there’s no need to require any other way to carry it.
<h3>5. Member Card Usage Tracking</h3>
As the organization, you can design rewards, specific communication, membership levels of access, and more to be delivered as incentives to your most active members, or use it to re-invigorate them into becoming more active. How you can track a member’s level of engagement can easily be seen via their usage of their digital membership cards, and you’ll have insights like nothing before.
<blockquote>If you're interested in learning how to use this data to engage your members, read our article on <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/boost-membership-engagement/"">6 Ways to Boost Your Member's Engagement in 2020!</a></blockquote>
If you’re looking to re-invigorate disengaged members, you can create email lists based on which members either attended the least number of events, used the card to access physical facilities the least amount of times, or those who never used it with partner retailers. Doing so delivers the power to your organization to do something about this disengagement and find different ways to engage them, and hopefully getting them to be more active and willing to renew their memberships.
<h2>Ditching Your Physical Cards</h2>
Ditching your physical membership cards is going to be tough, as it’s sort of becoming a no-thought-process aspect of managing members, but when you move to digital cards, you’ll realize that your management of the cards could actually be even more simplified, you’ll be able to track user actions to benefit your organization’s processes and offers, and you’ll be able to make more automatic changes to cards, en masse, without any need to make new cards or retrieve old ones.

16451,"7 Curious Marketing Trends You Need to Consider","On Jan 15th, EventBank held a series of panel discussions across Asia, including Hong Kong, Singapore, and the Philippines, to hear marketing trends being experienced or identified by marketing professionals.

As we all know, trends in marketing strategies are changing every single day, some more impactful than others, and through our panel discussions, we’ve unearthed some of the most important trends that you should consider going into 2020.
<h3>Quick Trends</h3>
<a href=""#privacy"">Privacy Concerns</a>
<a href=""#hiring"">Budgets &amp; Hiring</a>
<a href=""#social"">Social Detox</a>
<a href=""#influencer"">Influencer Shake-up</a>
<a href=""#support"">Social Support</a>
<a href=""#video"">Video Engagement</a>
<a href=""#google"">Google Weight-Loss</a>
<h2 id=""privacy"">Privacy Concern is at an All-Time High</h2>
Ever since the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica"">Cambridge Analytica scandal with Facebook</a>, users on social media took privacy concerns to such a level that it caused the EU to pass the GDPR laws that hold companies who save user data to strict accountability.

Of course, as most data collection exists in any company that’s online, they’re likely serving a global market, and therefore, GDPR has affected companies around the world and not just the EU.

Accountability has done little to sate the appetite of the privacy-concerned masses however, so it’s important to know that your potential customers are indeed very aware of your practices and will be sensitive to their data.

This has caused some minor behavioral patterns, for example, there’s been an easing of form questions on websites for contact pages, including reducing “Full Name” fields to just “Name”, and “Phone”, “Address”, and more being reduced to optional fields rather than required.

These form changes are not to comply with GDPR, but rather to ease the likelihood that users would complete the form without worrying about the data they’re about to give.
<h2 id=""hiring"">Budgets &amp; Hiring Trends Favor Data Roles</h2>
[caption id=""attachment_16453"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1254""]<img class=""wp-image-16453 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Marketing-Hiring-Trends.png"" alt=""marketing hiring trends"" width=""1254"" height=""478"" /> <b>Hiring Trends in 2019: What Role are Employers Looking for in Marketing Teams?</b>[/caption]

Recent trends in marketing, not just in the run-up to 2020, but in the past decade or more, have shifted away from creative roles in marketing, to more data-oriented roles.

With cost-effectiveness becoming a more prime strategy, companies are relying on data to point them in the right direction. Data collection has become so robust these days, that even the smallest of startups can run rudimentary A/B tests.

If campaign A performed better than campaign B, then we use A going forward. Simple, Sweet, and (mostly) risk-free marketing.

Something not shown here due to the small sample size is the growing usage of event-marketing in strategies. Check out some of our<a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/event-promotion-ideas/""> tips for running an engaging event</a>!
<h3>From the Panelists</h3>
However from our panelists these past weeks, we’ve also learned that data is somewhat taking a backseat role depending on the talent on-hand. While data is great, it’s useless unless you have marketers who can identify successes, problems, trends, or who is more willing to see the answer staring them in the face.

Another point from panelists includes that data is so granular these days, that it can overwhelm marketers and can often time blind them to some of the more basic marketing principals because they could have been following the wrong data points, in a world where there are now thousands of data-points available for a single customer.
<h2 id=""social"">People are Taking More Breaks from Social Media</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16458 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Digital-Detox.png"" alt=""digital detox"" width=""646"" height=""549"" />

A recent trend that currently has no real cure-all, is that users are taking more breaks from social media in lieu of recent fake news cases being circulated around Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

While these are of note, it’s only real effect is that some businesses may find fluctuating engagement on their social media pages that break the norm, but overall this just emphasizes the importance of good social media content to make the most of your follower-ship.
<h3>From the Panelists</h3>
During our panels, we learned from speakers and the audience that this general trend may not be as clear-cut as it seams. Yes, if you asked in a survey if people take breaks, a “break” could mean differently to different people.

Had they put down their phone for 5 minutes?

What if they are turning off their phone, but then switch to a PC? Maybe they consider not using their mobile device as a break, but still, continue using other devices.
<h2 id=""influencers"">Influencers with Fewer Followers Have Higher Engagement</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16455 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Social-Media-Trends.png"" alt=""influencer trends"" width=""665"" height=""329"" />

Influencers originally needed to have hundreds of thousands to millions of followers to land marketing gigs, but this trend is most certainly being bucked.

Nowadays and going into 2020, it’s important to influencers who are more targeted to your audience, which incidentally means they’ll likely have much fewer followers, and that’s a good thing.

As you reduce follower-ship but choose the right influencer to target your audience, you’ll find that you get more engagement. Refer to the above image to see a sample data set on this relationship.
<h2 id=""support"">Social Media as a Customer Support Platform</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16454 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SM-as-CS-2.png"" alt=""new trends in customer support favoring social media"" width=""990"" height=""507"" />

While Email and Phone are still the best channels for customer support, social media is rising quickly as a form of forum-replacement strategy.

With the ease of use of social media and constant notifications, it keeps your customer-base engaged and gives the aura of your company being transparent in a world where transparency is key.

It costs nothing, and moving your public discussions to social media will help spread your brand’s clout as an open, helpful, and active company.

Among this trend is something to keep an eye on when it comes to chatting apps. The line between social media and your favorite chatting application is getting more blurry as time goes on, so it’s smart to leave your Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, or WeChat link on your website so customers can reach out.

Even Facebook has released a feature for Facebook pages to place their page’s chat feature as a chat-box for websites as a first-touch chat option.

The beauty of this is that it instills a sense of community among your customers, and any questions could potentially be addressed by a customer to a fellow customer long before you get to it.
<h2 id=""video"">Video is a Growing Engagement Area</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16457 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Video-Length-Trends-2.png"" alt=""video length trends"" width=""1084"" height=""491"" />

Video is by far one of the highest-grossing areas for engagement and enacting users to buy. If done correctly, it can entice, convince, and persuade viewers to take a certain, and likely positive, stance on your product or service.

Duration of the video has some influence on the viewer, as the longer the video, the higher likely hood that their affinity with your brand increases. Shorter videos, therefore, convert less often but have a higher probability of being shared if they’re <b>engaging, entertaining, or educational</b>.

Video also depends heavily on the channel and medium you’re posting on, here’s some tips we uncovered during our panel discussions:
<ul>
 	<li>Post long-form videos on Youtube, since it’s algorithm prefers to promote longer length videos</li>
 	<li>Remember to always use subtitles when posting social media video content as all videos are played in Mute firstly</li>
 	<li>The first 3 seconds are crucial to getting someone’s attention when they scroll through their social feeds</li>
 	<li>Short-form videos don’t do well at all on YouTube but do extremely well on Facebook.</li>
 	<li>LinkedIn has a Max video length of 10 mins.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=""google"">Google is Making it Harder to Find You, and That’s OK</h2>
Google is changing the way it helps find what you’re looking for.

If you haven’t noticed, take a look at your latest Google search results on the first page.
You’ll notice that in some popular keywords your search, you actually have to scroll down before you can find the legitimate links found by the algorithm. Like So.

[caption id=""attachment_16462"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""818""]<img class=""wp-image-16462 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/google.png"" alt=""google results page is changing"" width=""818"" height=""942"" /> This entire results page is Ads[/caption]

Google has ceded a great majority of real-estate on results pages to ads, snippets, twitter quotes, images, video reels, definitions, Q&amp;As, and other functions that Google offers. If you’re a business with a popular or competitive keyword, you’ll start to find your website getting fewer visitors.

And that’s <strong>OK</strong>.

Google has identified that there are 2 types of searches people make on Google. One is<strong> confirmation intent</strong>, the other is <strong>problem-solution intent</strong>.

Confirmation intent is when we just need to quickly confirm the definition, flight time, time zone, calculation, currency exchange. We’re not interested in buying anything, we just want answers.

Problem-solution intent is when we’re searching for something that helps us with a problem. “Cheap shoes Oaklahoma” is not a confirmation search because the user has a problem of finding cheap, shoes, in Oaklahoma.

Therefore, the searcher will actively skip the Definition of “shoe”. They’ll skip the “Q&amp;A” post. They’ll skip the “shoe review” videos. The searcher will either click an Ad or scroll down to find the most appropriate website result.

So in the coming 2020 year, and we assume you are not expanding your page count on your website, you’re going to incur fewer website visitors, but should indeed have the same or increase in conversion rate from customers who are looking for your solution.

Or in other words, you’ll be filtering out visitors who just want a quick definition, leaving fewer bounces on your website, which then leads to better SEO.

There are a lot of trends coming up, we couldn’t list them all, and we probably wouldn’t be able to, but thanks to our panelists at our recent Marketing 2020 Predictions events across the region for participating.

16490,"6 Lessons for Chambers & Associations Going Into 2020","When it comes to the new year, it’s important to reflect on what worked in the past 12 months that we can take into the next.

EventBank held a series of events titled “Outlook 2020: Preparing Your Association for the New Year” in different cities, hosting association and chamber of commerce professionals on panel discussions to dive into what they’ve learned in 2019.

Let’s see what lesson’s they’ve learned.

Also, if you're in a sit-back-and-relax kind of mood, we've got a recording of one of our talks in Singapore for you to digest instead!

<h2>1. Your Association Needs to be Agile</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16374 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/saveyourchamber-38@2x.png"" alt="""" width=""618"" height=""528"" />

These days your average consumer is looking for immediate value in their purchases. This is the same truth for members at organizations, and with that in mind it’s becoming more important than ever to be agile as organizations when it comes to reciprocating a member’s dues payment.

Your members yearn for value, and it’s import to make sure they feel that this value is delivered. There’s a few ways to do this.
<ul>
 	<li><a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/craft-membership-welcome-package/"">Create a Welcome Package</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/provide-value-for-members/"">Offer Retail Benefits</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/member-journey-mapping/"">Deliver Your Association’s Road-map</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/associations-membership-experience/"">New Member Events &amp; Activities</a></li>
</ul>
Even if you cannot find a single thing to deliver to members, as long as you have a plan, presenting it early on in a member’s life-cycle will help give the expectation of value, which should help
<h2>2. It’s Not About Engaging Members</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16470 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eventbank-exploration-patterns-1-copy-dfsdsd-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-2@2x-2.png"" alt=""marketing trends in 2020"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

It’s about motivating them.

More than just Engagement, you should be motivating members and helping them become your champion. Engagement is a popular metric these days for success, but engagement cannot determine their inclination to renew, to attend an event, or introduce new members.

They need to be motivated to take action that benefits your organization, and to do that will take some high level personalization, rewards, awards, and exclusivity.

Potentially compartmentalizing or adding tiers your memberships can help members consider upgrading. Possibly benefits delivered for introducing new members or attending a certain number of events can help bolster ROI and entice members to renew.
<h2>3. Have Backup Plans</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16347 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eventbank-exploration-patterns-1-copy-6@2x.png"" alt="""" width=""2400"" height=""1288"" />

Losing your association’s GM or Chamber’s president has a cascading affect of potentially turning off members from renewing or attending events. It’s important to make sure that there’s always contingencies ready for lines of succession to take over the organization should there be an unexpected exit.

This goes the same for events if a venue changes, speaker drops out, and so on. Make sure that members are confident in your organisational and that this confidence comes from your role as an institution, and not whoever your leader is.
<h2>4. Leverage Tech</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16372 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/saveyourchamber-5@2x.png"" alt=""digital membership cards"" width=""1406"" height=""1138"" />

Obviously using tech is a great idea to lessen workloads and come off as a smarter organization in the end. Tech like CRMs help you to understand members and their history with your organizations, a helpful tool for new staff or GMs. Email campaigns are a great way to disseminate news, and apps help members talk to each other or push notifications to them.

Tech helps you scale as an organization as well. The issue at hand is that members all prefer a personalized approach, and scaling up with personalized communication is difficult. With tech on hand, you can create lists of contacts based on certain demographics or membership history that makes your communication more accurate and personalized.

An example could be using a CRM to see which members have attended the fewest events, replied the least to emails and so on, to help direct how the chamber can best tackle disengaged members to help reduce member turnover.
<h2>5. Get More Targeted</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16377 size-medium"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/saveyourchamber-992@2x-303x204.png"" alt="""" width=""303"" height=""204"" />

Run more niche, smaller events, because they speak to professionals better.

However, do not deviate from your association's vision. This is your core value that's not often talked about, but is integral to keeping your association stable. You can be elastic with your content, your tech, and your events, but your association must seem like it's inelastic to change that affects your value provided.

Keeping up with your organization’s vision is important in becoming an institution, and with that in mind, it’s even more important to know when it’s time to be elastic with what your events, communication, or content needs to be in order to be engaging (or as we’ve learned, motivating).
<h2>6. Focus on Your Value-Adding Members</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16141 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/value-copy-61@2x.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

We all want to be fair. But as businesses, organizations who need to pay the bills need to focus on it’s most engages and value-adding members.

Unlike typical businesses, members are indeed the exact value that your organization provides. They demand their own engagement, and with more members trying to find an organization to call home, some members will stand out more than others.

While we would all love to serve every member with the same gusto equally to come off as fair, it’s actually more profitable, scalable, and cost-effective to focus on corporate members.

They pay higher fees, they bring more bodies to events, and they’re more inclined to partner with organization activities. While some individual members may stand out and put forward the effort to help your organization (which they should be rewarded or recognized for), corporate members simply have more resources to help your organization.

Partnerships with corporate members help garner more members, better events, and better benefits delivered to members. Either through resources or networking connections, corporate members provide significantly better results, and so it’s pertinent that your organization puts focus on your corporate members in 2020.
<h2>Taking on 2020</h2>
2020 will be a new year full of new leaderships, members, and activities, and without a doubt a lot of learning in between. Through our event series that we run monthly across the globe, EventBank seeks to learn from the professionals on the ground how they're tackling challenges at their organizations.

If you're looking for a smarter way to run your organization, manage your members, and then deliver value to your members, consider <strong>booking a product tour with us</strong>, and we'll show you how EventBank has been helping hundreds of organizations grow their memberships without breaking a sweat.

16517,"These 7 Event Management Hard-Skills Will Help You Wildly","So you have an event coming up, and planning is starting to look like a losing battle.

Have we hit the nail on the head?

Even if we’re off-target, you get what we’re talking about.

Event management skills are not always the soft-skills that other people would have you believe. Yes, you can have people skills, and good time-management, and understand scheduling, blablabla. But it’s without a doubt becoming more of a requirement for you to host engaging, tech-driven, and shareable events for attendees while supporting any partners or sponsors you might have.

So sure, you’ve got all the nice people and time-management skills you could ever muster, but without these x hard-skills, your event may hang in the balance.

<h2 id=""email"">Email Marketing Prowess</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3292 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Email-Campaigns-Ad-Copy@2x.png"" alt=""event email marketing guide"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Emailing is simply the easiest and more cost-effective form of marketing and communication any organization can muster. This is no different for events, and having even a broad idea of how email marketing works will help your attendance immensely.

Email marketing is different from emailing, in the fact that you really shouldn’t be blasting emails from your inbox. You need to be using email marketing tools to do this like mailchimp, mix, or if you want to be more targeted, event-email-marketing tools like us here at EventBank.

These tools specialize in helping you create great looking, dynamic, and professional emails that get delivered en-mass without tripping spam filters that you would be had you blasted emails from you inbox in some huge CC fiasco. They’re typically easy to use, but may require some web-admin interaction to help you set up the cross-domain installation so that emails that are sent from these tools use your email server URL names.

Emails like this require some design skills, but if you’re not a stickler, you can get away with templates provided by the tools. While the obvious use-case is to use these to <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/event-email-marketing-strategies/"">invite attendees</a>, they’re also super helpful for reminding them, delivering their tickets, links, and even post-event surveys.
<h2 id=""website"">Event Page Design</h2>
<img class=""alignright wp-image-15458 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Content-Management-System-CMS-EventBank-Website-Solutions.png"" alt=""Chamber of Commerce Website Solutions"" width=""2754"" height=""1774"" />

Your event needs a home-base, and a website is perfect for that, especially in the age we’re in now where everyone is online. You can deliver information, scheduling, speaker slots, maps of the event space, process registrations and ticketing and more.

Making an entire website dedicated to large events is an option but for one-off or small scale events that don’t require so much elbow grease should opt to use event-website builders. They let you borrow a domain name, <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/event-website-builder/"">drag-and-drop design the website</a>, or in some cases, entirely build it for you based on a few of your event parameters and details.

Having a website also make it more professional which is great for enticing sponsors or vendors to support your event, of course you will need to give kudos on said event website for them.
<h2 id=""tracking"">Attendee Tracking</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16516 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eventbank-exploration-patterns-1-copy-dfsdsd-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-3@2x.png"" alt=""chambers and associations"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Attendee tracking is crucial if you’re looking to host events where the point is to gain some level of ROI, or even better, if you run a series of events. Tracking attendees can be as easy as knowing if they registered online or not, or as finely details as heatmapping the event floor so you know which booth was most popular and so on.

While attendee tracking can get very eerie with how grossly details it can be with facial recognition making it’s way into very large event spaces so it can both check you in and track where you’ve been, who you spoke with, and when spoke to them, it’s probably something out of your league.

What you should be tracking, however, is attendee check-in method, time, and place. This info gives<a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/member-journey-mapping/""> a lot of helpful information</a> into which channel worked best to entice registrations so you know where to invest next time, or it can be helpful to segment your audience further for follow-up engagement.

This is why it’s important to be good at the previous event web page and email set up skillsets. Without good tracking, you can be often blind as to what to do next with these skills. If you need ROI at your event because you’re inadvertaintly selling your product or services, emailing attendees after the event concludes can often times be far more important than before the event. It’s also a great time to get feedback and send surveys too.

This further compounds the absolutely necessity for you to understand the digital landscape of your event so you can:
<ul>
 	<li>Add UTM tracking codes to URLs to see where attendees came from</li>
 	<li>Understand where attendees start the registration process and drop out</li>
 	<li>Know which email campaign worked best</li>
 	<li>What time of day attendees register</li>
 	<li>If and when they check in at the event</li>
 	<li>Infinitely More</li>
</ul>
Without this insight, it can be tough to come up with good campaigns. For instance, you could drum up a list of attendees who registered but didn’t check in at the event to either ask what the problem was, or offer a better package for them at a discount for your next event.
<h2 id=""crm"">Contact Management</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16140 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/value-copy-61@2x-1.png"" alt=""contact management"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Contact Management is also fairly straight forward.

How are you managing contacts to maximize your communication?

Hand-in-hand with attendee tracking, this is the part where you need to take action, and segment your audience. Also known as a CRM, contact management is mean to give you a workshop where you can craft segments of your audience for targeted marketing, notifications, or communication. It also helps you keep a history of every contact’s actions taken with your event from every email open, to every check-in.

This gets even more important as you create lists necessary for email campaigns, push notifications, or special offers. Contacts who register for events but never show up can give clues based on theri demographics about why. Maybe they're too far away from even spaces, maybe they just don't have enough transportation. Info like this can give pertinent clues into how you can improve your event's communication and operations to make it excel.
<h2 id=""tech"">Event-Tech Knowledge</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16470 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eventbank-exploration-patterns-1-copy-dfsdsd-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-2@2x-2.png"" alt=""marketing trends in 2020"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

This is fairly straight forward. Do you know how to set up stage lights? Microphones? Check-in software?

Tech in events is another core part of any event, and it just takes practice and getting used to. We wish we could dive in, maybe in a later article, but if you need any hard skills, it’s should be (fairly) basic knowledge of tech used at events from the mundane to the highly-advanced.

So, it can be pretty easy to set up microphones or projectors and screens, but it can be a little more difficult if your event is going to opt-in for a QR code scanner or tablet display check in counter where these systems need to somehow connect succinctly to your website in order to complete the attendee tracking journey.
<h2 id=""space"">Event Space Matching</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-379 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wechat.jpeg"" alt=""maintaining subscribers"" width=""1283"" height=""1026"" />

Event spaces need to match your event, and it’s a fairly good skill to have when it comes to choosing venues. Typically in bigger cities you have less leeway with how event spaces are chosen as the city ordnance will direct certain areas and building to be for events.

However as you get further from bureaucratic-lines, you can have some freedom in where and even how events are hosted. For instance retro-fitting warehouses because they’re cheaper spaces, or hosting tented events, and outdoor events. The world tends to be your oyster when it comes to event spaces as you get further away from city-centers. The closed you are in a city, the more expensive and restricted it will be.

Now as you choose spaces, obviously convenience and aesthetics are nice eyes to have out for these spaces, but also it should be the layout. Does it make sense for you? Do you need more equipment to wall-off certain areas? Is it too big or too small?

You can also partner with event spaces who specialize in helping equip your event with rentable tables, chairs, and even electronics to help facilitate you.
<h2 id=""speaker"">Speaker Synergy</h2>
<img class=""not full aligncenter wp-image-16377 size-medium"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/saveyourchamber-992@2x-303x204.png"" alt="""" width=""303"" height=""204"" />

Most events have speakers, and usually those speakers are guests.

Now, while sometimes you can be close to these speakers, and understand who they are, or have some background of past talks they’ve given, it can be detrimental to make sure there’s synergy with who’s speaking or MCing your event.

When you are working with third parties without any prior experience together, it can be a dice-roll when it comes to how they talk to the audience, what they say, and how they’ll say it. It’s important here to make sure you establish either hierarchy over who runs the show, or freedom.

For instance if you have a panel discussion, panelists can often times go on tangents or get off topic for any reason, and it’s the job of the MC to get them back on track. If your MC speaker is not willing or has no experience aligning a panel to the topic when it gets off-topic, then it can potentially bore attendees or in some cases crash an event.

It sounds like it goes again the grain, but if you actually give some responsibility to the speaker and set the expectation that they’re in charge and they have the onus to keep the show on the road, then they’re likely to take it far more seriously, and therefore keep the audience taking it seriously too.

Speakers have a big impact on the attendees, so please make sure your speakers or MCs are in-line with your event’s talking points and that they’re aware they have some level of authority over the stage.

16551,"The Importance of Digital Communication for Organizations During COVID 19","With the rapidly concerning coronavirus or, COVID 19, threat looming over the globe, it’s important for organizations to communicate, cancel, re-evaluate events, expectations and activities for members and attendees alike. With professionals working at home to stymie the spread of the virus, it is fast-become known as the world’s biggest work-from-home experiment, and this directly affects organizations and events.

Cancelling or Postponing an event, especially when it happens because of reasons out of your control, is one of the most headache-inducing problems you can possible face. More than the headache, you just feel embarrassed.

With EventBank's offices around the globe, we've been dealing with the virus outbreak since it's first coverage in media, and we'd like to share some early on communication and strategies used by some of our clients using EventBank to take their events and engagement digital as they adjust for webinars and video conferences in place of their planned physical events. We hope it can help your organization understand the importance of digital communication during this outbreak.
<h2>The Importance of Communication</h2>
<img class=""notfull wp-image-16560 size-full aligncenter"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/canceled-lux.png"" alt="""" width=""612"" height=""496"" />

Communication is the number one priority action needed to dispel disappointment, inform members and contacts of news and upcoming changes, and offer alternatives to anything that’s been impacted. A member may refute renewal of their membership, or refuse to attend events in times of emergency when in fact you may be offering alternatives or reassurance, leaving more control of the situation in your hands, all while keeping your audience safe.

As a case study, EventBank handles clients across the world, and crisis like coronavirus have made an impact on these organizations in where events and other activities needed to be postponed or cancelled as it was no longer advisable to have larger gatherings of people in order to stem the spread of the virus.

In an attempt to lessen the impact this crisis had organizations made efforts to deliver pertinent information to members and contacts with notifications of cancelled events, and then provided alternatives to these events, so that this would not affect their performance and value-provided services as severely.

In doing so, communication is the prime method of protecting attendees and members in any times of crisis. It also acts as a channel for proper delivery of alternatives like remote webinar events.

When communicating cancellations and news of crisis at your organization or event, remember to follow a few key rules that help to make it easy for your audience to engage online.
<h3>Step 1. Turn Off Any Ticketing Systems</h3>
Specifically for events, turn off ticketing immediately. Don’t let people register for an event that’s cancelled, fairly straight forward.
<h3>Step 2. Refund event tickets/discount members for their next renewal</h3>
<img class=""notfull aligncenter wp-image-16561 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Spanish-Chamber.png"" alt="""" width=""630"" height=""766"" />

For events, always refund tickets in full, and for organizations, it’s optional, but recommended that you offer discounts to current members who are close to renewing as a way to apologize for the lessening or lack of engagement and services provided during the situation.
<h3>Step 3. Offer Alternative Events/Services</h3>
Offer an alternative event that doesn’t put anyone at risk, like making an ideal event into an online webinar.
<h3>Step 4. Give a Time-frame and Point of Contact</h3>
<img class=""notfull aligncenter wp-image-16559 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/AmCham-Member-Portal.png"" alt="""" width=""655"" height=""788"" />

Finally, give your audience a way to keep in the loop with what’s going on, maybe a schedule of news or events, as well as a point of contact for any and all questions concerning the situation.
<h2>When Should You Cancel or Postpone Events?</h2>
This is possibly the most crucial part before you start cancelling and postponing an event. If you can’t identify the right cue for cancellation and postponement, then you risk have a terrible event, which is a much worse situation than just having cancelled instead.

Let’s identify some of the biggest cues you can take from to identify when it might be time to cancel.
<h3>Internal Cues</h3>
Internal Cues are hints from your end of the event bargain that can implicate a failed event in the horizon. These are not cues your attendees can easily understand, but at the same time you’re typically in control of some of them, and it’ll be up to your ability to manage these cues before they become a problem, but inevitably one day they very well may become such a big issue, it causes cancellation
<h4><b>Not enough attendees</b></h4>
This one is different for each event manager/team, as it' just depends on the goal of the event. There's a break-even point for events looking to make ROI off the ticket sales, and for event where ROI is not a goal but something less superfluous, may have a more ambiguous attendee break-even point.

For instance, if you’re running an ROI-centric event, and you need a certain amount of attendees purchasing tickets, then there’s a key number of attendees at which their purchases pay for the cost of the event. However for free events or events with other KPI’s than ROI in mind, then you’re likely going to have to work with a number that’s made up for one reason or another.

If you fall below that number, the even may not entirely be a bust for your attendees, but it might bust the bank.

If you would like to learn more about calculating Event ROI, read our post on it here.
<h4><b>Speakers drop out </b></h4>
This is less your fault in most cases, and it can be hard to avoid. This is when a key speaker at your event dropped out, and there’s absolutely no way the show can go on without them. Usually this is for Panel speaker MC’s, Keypoint Speaker, Hosts, and so on.

This is easily remedied by having more backup speakers than you might expect. However in some cases if the event is specifically about that speaker like a Book Signing, or Concert, then yeah, definitely might want to cancel or postpone.
<h4><b>Venue Cancels </b></h4>
This one is also a bit out of your hands as well, like speakers dropping out, there’s little control you have over the venue pulling out, though it’s rare they would do this last-minute, it can sometimes happen.

The good news is that usually this happens with a lot of prior notice and plenty of time to find a backup, but if your event hinges on the location, then this might be a cancellation point for you.
<h4><b>Understaffed</b></h4>
This cue is more in your hands than anything else and is entirely controllable (to a point). Staffing an event is obviously important to run the mundane tasks that keep things running smoothly. Depending on your event’s content, activities, and offerings, you’ll need staff to handle them. First and foremost is check-in and registration boothing, then just take it from there.

However if you find yourself with staff dropping out or no one taking the job, then you might want to consider postponing or cancelling if there’s no other help to be had.
<h4><b>Technical Issues</b></h4>
Technical issues can cause havoc, It’s entirely preventable in most cases, but without tech-wizards nearby when a crucial malfunction happens, you might be left in rock and a hard place. Lights may pop, speaks can break, projectors may just not work at all, or you simply brought the wrong equipment with ill-fitting plugs and sockets that don’t match the venue’s offerings.

It’s important to dry run all electronics before an event to make sure nothing major can hamper the success of the event, but alas, if there’s a city-wide power outage right before a movie premier, then you might want to consider hosting it another day.
<h3>External Cues</h3>
External Cues are simple, and more understandable for attendees to swallow when it happens. These are cues completely outside of your realm of control. These are things that not only affect your event, but your attendees lives as well. Let’s dig in.
<h4><b>Safety</b></h4>
Safety is your #1 priority. That means if weather is dangerous, bad driving conditions, or unsafe whatever that can affect your attendees from their front door to your event’s conclusion and that risk is undeniably larger than normal, it would be best advised to postpone or cancel the event.
<b></b>
<h4><b>Tragedy </b></h4>
Some events should be cancelled in lieu of local, national, or global tragedies in respect of the casualties and victims. This is extremely important as hosting an event in bad taste can mar your event or company’s reputation.
<b></b>
<h4><b>Travel Traffic </b></h4>
If traffic is going to be a problem in places where it’s hard to get around, or during periods of great migration like Chinese New Year in China, or the Hajj in the Middle East. This can even be as local as an Metro line closing for repairs or highways closed for accidents. If your attendees can’t attend, then rescheduling might be the more appropriate move.
<b></b>
<h4><b>Health</b></h4>
Health, like Safety, can be more optional than anything, but it’s in your best interests to keep your attendee’s best interests. If your attendees can get sick, have allergies, or otherwise suffer health problems by attending your event, then it’s high time your postpone and find a better way to host the event, or a venue with health in mind.

This is especially important during issues like outbreaks like the Coronavirus that’s been affecting events across Asia in 2020 where having large gatherings of people would pose health risks.
<b></b>
<h4><b>Social (Media) Consciousness </b></h4>
Social consciousness is not a tangible affect on your event’s success, but more of a collective set if ideals that if not listened to, can cause unforeseen consequences. This, like Tragedy Cues, are more or less the same, because you could be left hosting an event in bad-taste.

Putting together an event on the Holocaust during a Jewish holiday may sound like a thoughtful idea, but without listening to social cues from society and understanding early social conscious on the issue, you might actually cause more harm than good. It’s best left to avoid and cancel these events that rub your audience the wrong way.

Early listening may help nay major loss, or could even help to restore an event by using social media as your best friends. Social media conversations are a great way to gauge how your audience thinks, and give early clues at to your event’s reception when it’s ready to go public. Thankfully, social media has proven to be a phenomenal tool when it comes to social listening if you simply follow some of the biggest topics, hashtags and influencers relevant to you.

16600,"10 Event Website Templates that Wow Attendees","Event websites are a great way to make a first impression to potential attendees, and they also act as the home base for all things about your event, including the time, place, schedule, ticketing, speakers, sponsors, and so on. However not all event websites are the same, and the easiest way to go about it is to find the right template for your event’s size or purpose.
<h2>Large Events, Conferences, &amp; Expos</h2>
Large events are one of the most complex types of events out there. They usually run more than one day, and sometimes running multiple activities, also known as tracks or sessions, at the same time as others, making it very hard to manage or even deliver conceptually on a website.
<h3>1. Cappuccino</h3>
<b>Main Elements</b>
<ul>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">Multi-track Banner</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">Customizable Footer &amp; Header</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">Session Tags</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">Countdown</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">Sponsors/Partners Section</span></li>
</ul>
<iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/XbbVTqCetw8"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe>
Event templates are pre-designed with the structure of your event in mind, and the Cappuccino event template is a feature-packed template meant for long, large, and complex events.

Cappuccino is ideal for major events like annual conferences, summits or congresses, which includes a countdown timer, customizable footer &amp; menu layout, session tags, event statistics and more options to show your biggest events in the best light possible.
<h3>Stroopwafle Frappuccino</h3>
Main Elements
<ul>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">High-Impact Banner</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">Multi-track Agenda</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">Sponsors/Partners Section</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">Map</span></li>
</ul>
<img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-16635"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Stroopwafel-Frappuccino@2x-1.png"" alt="""" width=""1200"" height=""808"" />

Stroopwafle Frappuccino is another type of long-form event website template that focuses on telling the story of the event starting with the header image call to action, and then moving from most pertinent to least as the user scrolls down. Like Cappuccino, the template is meant for large events, and so includes some similar elements like multi track listings and so on.

It’s color settings focus on a primary and a secondary color that help accent brands who typically have a primary color, and in doing so helps to accent the entire template to your branding.
<h2>Medium Sized Events &amp; Conferences</h2>
Medium events and conferences are less stringent on the complexities that plague large events, but are often times in need of the same elements as large event templates use, but with a more succinct focus on the topic at hand rather than multiple topics.
<h3>Iced Latte</h3>
Main Elements
<ul>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">Important Information Highlighted</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">Full Menu at sight</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">High Visibility Organizer Logo</span></li>
</ul>
<img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-16631"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Iced-Latte@2x-1.png"" alt="""" width=""1200"" height=""808"" />

Ice Latte is a template that aims to be simple while leveraging the power of a high visibility hero image in the main home page. Doing do allows there to be a relatively simplistic menu and content presentation that helps to deliver the pertinent information about the event at first glance, and helps to deliver information through a customizable menu.

With support for event communities, this template is great for medium sized events that don’t run multi-track events, but are still large enough to warrant community management and access.
<h3>Caramel Macchiato</h3>
Main Elements
<ul>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">Important Information Highlight</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">Full Menu at sight</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">Large Data</span></li>
</ul>
<img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-16629"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Caramel-Machiatto@2x-1.png"" alt="""" width=""1200"" height=""808"" />

Caramel Macchiato is an event website template that focuses on a more ‘professional’ vibe, but keeps things simple by having all the important event info actually visible in the header image itself. The template focuses on post-event reviews by allowing for long-tail pages that can highlight events and pictures from the event similar to a social feed.
<h3>Cafe Cubano</h3>
Main Elements
<ul>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">Highlight Speaker</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">Highlight Organizer Logo</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">High Visibility Banner</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">Location Hiding</span></li>
</ul>
<img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-16632"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Lemon-Tea-Copy@0.5x.png"" alt="""" width=""1200"" height=""808"" />

Cafe Cubano template is hyper-focused on speaker centric events. While most events will revolve around a certain topic, events where there is a single speaker are quite common as well. Due to the nature of a single speaker, multi-track or multi-day templates are not needed, and a simple template will work wonders to keep the focus on the speaker.

The template if you notice by now follows a trend of having a high-visibility hero image to make the page attractive, but placing the head-shot of the speaker at the top to make it very clear the purpose of this event.

This template also includes the ability to hide the location as some speaking events could be online courses and webinars.
<h3>Cafe Mocha</h3>
Main Elements
<ul>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">Countdown</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">Fist Glance Add to Calendar</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">Highlight Agenda</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">Showcase Tickets</span></li>
</ul>
<img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-16627"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Cafe-Mocha@2x-1.png"" alt="""" width=""1200"" height=""808"" />

While Cafe Cubano can be rigged into a seminar focuses template, Cafe Mocha has the opposite use case, where it is used with a core focus on online-only or webinar events, but is sometimes used for in-person events. The template is a sister-template of Cafe Cubano so nothing about it should surprise you from the above, except the non-speaker focus, and taking on a more traditional event web template format.
<h2>Small Events</h2>
Small events are in need of a more focused experience in order to deliver value to visitors. With this in mind templates for smaller events will need to buck normal event website trends in order to deliver a better converting experience. This means less focus on schedules typically, and more on the content provided at the event. Larger events are likely by word of mouth understood what topics will be presented, maybe speakers are well known already. But at smaller events, it may take some convincing from the website what the content is and how it’s valuable.
<h3>Espresso</h3>
Main Elements
<ul>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">Custom Banner</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">One-Pager</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">All Speakers at sight</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">High Brand Visibility</span></li>
</ul>
<img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-16630"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Espresso@2x-1.png"" alt="""" width=""1200"" height=""808"" />

Espresso is a template that is a single-page event website that aims to only have the most pertinent information about the event in one place with minimal navigation blocking a visitor’s way from reading. It is in this case a more small-event focused template but has been used to help supplement medium sized events as well.
<h3>Americano</h3>
Main Elements
<ul>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">Venue Highlight</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">Card Single-page Layout</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""color: #00b832;"">High Mobile Responsiveness</span></li>

The Americano template is another small scale event website template that bucks the high visibility homepage images and goes for a more balanced setup of the content that allows more use of images as a tool to complement to the content. It has all your event needs in a single page layout with a specifically good mobile responsiveness due to the balanced format leaving content more fit for small form factor screens.

Lemon Tea is by far the most technically functional template for small events. Another one-pager with a special element that follows the reader no matter how far they scroll down with all the event details and a call-to-action for registration. This template is ideal for visitors who may not have heard from you before and require a very clear and persistent CTA in order to convert for more registrations.

Noisette is a great template for small-form events that need a professional look and feel. With a fairly plain but clear header, it takes a focus more on info-delivery than visual pleasantries. Perfect for events where attendees need to be informed and prepared beforehand like courses, meetings and private conferences. This template however has been seen used in a myriad of other event formats with great feedback and so strictly speaking this is a safe-bet template should your creative skills not be up to par for other templates.

16651,"Chamber Myth Busters: 8 Myths About Chambers of Commerce Dispelled","The common idea about a Chamber of Commerce is that it’s a group of over-paid, senior, crotchety old men and women that pat themselves all on the back and do business with each other. It’s been a huge misunderstanding about what chambers of commerce stand for, and who they’re comprised of for the longest of time, and it’s myths and prejudiced ideas of chambers of commerce are only helping to maintain their composure.

In fact, Chambers of Commerce offer far more than you might expect. So we’ve decided to dispel a few common myths and preconceptions of chambers of commerce so you don’t get the wrong idea.
<h2>1. They’re a part of the government</h2>
[caption id=""attachment_16653"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""600""]<img class=""wp-image-16653 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/US_Chamber_of_Commerce_Building_insert_by_Almonroth_via_Wikimedia.jpg"" alt=""us chamber of commerce"" width=""600"" height=""400"" /> While the name is U.S. Chamber of Commerce, it is actually a long-standing PAC that engages in direct politics in the U.S.. In reality it is not a real chamber of commerce as you're used to seeing.[/caption]

One of the biggest misconceptions about chambers of commerce is that they’re a part of the government. In fact most chambers of commerce around the globe are not part of any government and are self governed, profit-seeking organizations that make profits through membership dues and events, like any other company.

This misconception is largely due to that fact that a lot of governments will have departments or agencies called “The” Chamber of Commerce, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in which it is not actually a chamber of commerce, but actually a political action group which directly deals with lobbying, something no real chamber of commerce does, and so it can often times make local chambers of commerce seem political, when in actuality, it is not.

Chambers of commerce are more properly businesses themselves, who’s core value is the support provided to local, regional, or national businesses depending on their intended strategy, or in other cases to direct industries or demographics, we'll get into this a bit later.
<h2>2. It’s only for senior level professionals</h2>
<img class=""notfull aligncenter wp-image-16377 size-medium"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/saveyourchamber-992@2x-303x204.png"" alt=""professional"" width=""303"" height=""204"" />

Another large misconception that is becoming a hindrance to the growth of chambers of commerce is that it’s mostly made up of older or retired business owners, execs or professionals. This is not the case however, and most chambers of commerce are looking for members of all ages to breathe fresh ideas into the chamber. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong has launched specific marketing campaigns to target young professionals just out of university to bring more young members in via their <a href=""https://www.cancham.org/mentorshipprogram-s8/"">mentorship programme</a>.

This has opened new avenues for membership types as well for chambers seeking new channels of funding, where members instead of becoming a collaborative individual in the chamber, are instead taken in as mentees where more senior chamber members can mentor younger chamber members to help with their career growth.
<h2>3. Chambers are boring</h2>
[caption id=""attachment_16655"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1600""]<img class=""wp-image-16655 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CANROCKS1.png"" alt=""canada chamber of commerce gala"" width=""1600"" height=""1021"" /> In a bid to reach younger professionals, the annual gala promotion at CanCham Hong Kong has taken on vibrant color schemes and clearly reaches a younger audience to incentivize younger members to join.[/caption]

Chambers have a general image of being a boring, aged, and antiquated form of doing business. In a world where digital and speedy, exciting ways of doing business are more preferred, this concept of a boring, boardroom style business can be a turn off for professionals seeking the “new” thing.

This can sometimes be true for older chambers not willing to make the jump into technology, new industries, or generally mixing it up. But the reality is that change is necessary for success in any business, and chambers of commerce are like any other business, and if you were to look under the skin of most chambers, you’ll find events, networking, and committees dedicated to what piques your interest.

Chambers of commerce also elect their own leadership in frequent periods, so generally speaking chambers should be shaking things up with new leadership taking the chamber in new directions with new types of events being experimented with and new members churning into the chamber.
<h2>4. They’re just for networking</h2>
<img class=""notfull aligncenter wp-image-9906 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-22.png"" alt=""benefits"" width=""574"" height=""577"" />

Chambers of commerce from the outside looking in, you can see that it’s most common activity is hosting events, mostly for networking or helping to sponsor business-friendly events in the area. This is however just what the chamber does on the surface since it’s the most visible activity that they are entrenched in.

In reality chambers of commerce, particularly larger ones, will have different services for members and even sometimes non-members depending on the chamber’s resources available. Consultations are typically provided to business members as likely the second most popular activity that goes on behind closed doors at chambers, with other services like the aforementioned mentorship programmes, professional coaching, and even marketing &amp; advocacy services for members. Some chambers of commerce even offer courses for professional development with certificates.
<h2>5. Chambers are not for Non-Profits</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15478 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/value-copy-18@2x-1.png"" alt=""association revenue ideas"" width=""2400"" height=""1288"" />

Non-profits are organizations that have overhead like any other business. If you’re an NGO reading this, we don’t need to tell you that running an NGO is like running any other business. And so the myth that Chambers only serve profit-making companies is unsubstantiated.

NGOs have budgets and need to spend money to help grow their organization as if it were a company like any other, and if joining a chamber of commerce is decided to be in it’s best interest, you would likely catch more than a handful of chambers of commerce with NGOs and charities as members benefiting from the networking and other member benefits that a chamber could provide to an NGO.
<h2>6. Membership is too costly</h2>
<img class=""notfull aligncenter wp-image-16411 size-medium"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MembershipCard-278x204.png"" alt=""physical membership card"" width=""278"" height=""204"" />

Chambers of commerce can seem pricey since the average costs of an individual membership is around $400, to $600 annually at smaller chambers, and upwards of $5000 per year for larger or statewide chambers. But this is just scratching the surface of “costly”. How much does being a member bring business to you as a professional or a business member? Has one good networking connection brought in more $$$ than the cost of your membership?

As well, joining chambers of commerce as corporate members may unlock a limited or even unlimited number of member-level access for your employees to attend events hosted by the chamber, spreading the cost of the membership among employees that drive down the per-head cost of joining as a corporate member.

However just joining a chamber does not mean you’ll reach ROI magically. Chambers of commerce require cooperation, engagement, and active members giving feedback and participating to make it work. It only works if you work it.
<h2>7. Chambers only care about local businesses</h2>
[caption id=""attachment_16657"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""380""]<img class=""not full wp-image-16657 size-medium"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/USWCC_Logo_black_transparent-380x79.png"" alt=""US women's chamber of commerce"" width=""380"" height=""79"" /> The US Women's Chamber of Commerce is an example of a chamber of commerce that's not region-specific.[/caption]

This is untrue. While local chambers of commerce are plentiful, it can seem like most chambers are focused on local businesses and challenges simply because every town, city, state, province, etc has a chamber that helps the region.

What you might not know is that larger chambers in your area are actually quite national, or even global. Chambers understand that a local business these days highly-likely has customers and employees around the globe, and are partnering with chambers abroad using ""chamber passports"". These are effectively a right for you, a member of your local chamber in the US for instance, to enjoy the rights as a member at other chambers abroad like your local American Chamber of Commerce in China, Brazil, UK, and so on.

So if you're a frequent business traveller, you might want to consider how much support a membership at your ""local"" chamber might actually provide you during your travels.

In fact, chambers can bridge industries and demographics that might actually pertain to your professionally or career-wise better than a local chamber, especially if your business makes your travel or work with clients that stretch farther than your home country. Some instances might be the U.S. Women’s Chamber of Commerce, the National Black Chamber of Commerce, and the Africa Energy Chamber of Commerce to name a few chambers that buck the localization trends traditional chambers have.
<h2>8. It’s made up of volunteer staff</h2>
[caption id=""attachment_16658"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]<img class=""wp-image-16658 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/greater-omaha-chamber-of-commerce-offices-omaha-7-1200x800-1-1024x683.jpg"" alt=""Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce Offices"" width=""1024"" height=""683"" /> This is a sneak peak into the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce offices. At EventBank we visit our chamber clients often and their offices are increasingly taking a new on a shared-office vibe.[/caption]

There’s a myth that Chambers of Commerce are made of volunteers businesspersons working as if it was an NGO asking for donations and so on. In reality chambers as we’ve said before, are like businesses, and the only thing that’s different, is that there is a voting structure for a chamber’s board of directors (rather than shareholder based ownership seating in the board).

Once a board is voted in, it’s time to hire a new CEO/President/Executive Director of the Chamber, and the staff needed to support it’s activities. Staff and offices of chambers of commerce are often times reminiscent of typical offices, because, it is again, like any other business and requires a full time staff and the proper offices to run the organization’s hundreds of annual events, meetings, and proper admin work needed to manage it’s memberships, finances, and services.

We hope that his has dispelled a few preconceptions you had yourself about chambers of commerce, or even just learned something new about chambers you didn’t know before. Chambers of commerce are struggling to buck these mis-interpretations that they’re antiquated and like any free-market entities, are rapidly changing their activities, structure, and services to match an ever rapidly changing business environment. If you feel you might not be a fit for your local or industry chamber of commerce, give them a call and listen to what they have to offer, you might like what you hear.

If you're a chamber of commerce reading this, maybe you need to shake up your chamber's membership engagement and events.

16669,"How to Get Attendees Networking at Conferences & Expos","You’ve got a big conference or some sort of expo you need to put together, and you have to make it so that attendees get what they’re looking for when they arrive. If it’s not vendors, it’s high-likely that attendees are looking to meet with other attendees and exchange the ol’ business card or two.

Problem is, if your event is egregiously large, let’s say more than 500, it might be very difficult to get people to talk to each other and make the most of their time.

There are, however, a few ways you can organize or implement new ideas into your conference so that attendees can get a shot at meeting possibly everyone else no matter how large your even gets.
<h2>Attendee-to-Attendee Chat Apps</h2>
<img class=""alignleft wp-image-16674 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/attendee-to-attendee-chat-eventbank@2x-909x1024.png"" alt="""" width=""909"" height=""1024"" />
A fairly straight forward solution is to implement an event-wide app that helps attendees connect, and find one another.

Usually though an attendee-to-attendee chat platform which is widely being adopted at expos where attendees have started getting skittish about coming again the next year because they simply didn’t meet enough other attendees to justify the sometimes thousands of USD price tag a ticket can go for at a lot of events.

Attendee-to-attendee chat can provide attendees the opportunity to chat with attendees without even meeting them in person, but by being at the same event, they share an experience that helps to bring down barriers to introductions and break the ice so to speak.

This also makes it easier for attendees to meet one another during event downtimes and helps them navigate the venue instead of bumbling around trying to find someone they could have been looking for but didn’t have their contact info prior.

Attendee-to-attendee chat can be somewhat of a pandora’s box as well. There’s a probability that some attendees might be annoyed with unsolicited direct messages, and that could easily turn off attendees, or even worse, VIPs who might be sought after by a good majority of attendees who would have liked to meet them.

To this end it’s important to pick a chat provider that knows how to create certain permissions and filters that allow attendees to talk with one another, but to leave out some individuals so as to not annoy them. There are other neat ways to limit the white noise of messages like creating specific chat rooms, limiting on-going chats for attendees, and so on.
<h2>Break-out Session Areas</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-10646 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/EventBankDD_12.jpg"" alt=""attendee break out session"" width=""1619"" height=""1080"" />

A more traditional and familiar method of facilitating networking at your next conference/expo, is the use of break-out-sessions as a part of the event scheduling.

This also requires making space for these breakout sessions so that people can mingle and talk. This is where it’s important to create clear nametags that are easy to see at a glance.

There is no guarantee that all attendees will be able to use this method depending on the size of your event, and if you have vendors, it’s probably best to spread out these break out sessions areas of the event floor to different areas so as not to crowd potentially thousands of people into one area in an loud and uncomfortable setting.

Higher level ticket holders, if your ticket strategy allows for this, should help create different tiers of break out session areas so that certain attendees with the right level of access can gain access to break out areas where they can converse with speakers and other VIPs. This should help VIPs feel not so attacked with thousands of attendees trying to get to them for a quick card swap.
<h2>Connect Attendees on Social Media</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15303 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/eventbank-exploration-patterns-8-copy-8@2x.png"" alt=""membership social media"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

A fairly new but not widely method of encouraging networking at large events is the use of social media to create pages or communities so that attendees can have public discussions online before, during and after the event to help foster prearranged meetups or post event meetings.

This also helps the event organizer have more of a bird’s eye view of the general consensus of the vent before and after the event.

Social listening is an incredibly helpful asset to any large event, and it gives enough forewarning about complaints, praise, or notable attendees that will swing by.

It also gives your side of the event a platform to disseminate news and information like sharing event floor maps, special additions or last minute changes.

But back to networking, this helps attendees familiarize themselves with other attendees and essentially it gives a somewhat fair platform for them to reach out and speak to one other, or voice themselves so that they can meet up with other attendees during the event, or to use it after the event to see attendees whom they had not had the chance to meet.
<h2>Host a Post-Event Happy Hour</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-265 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/networking-event-e1495422285915.jpg"" alt=""collecting photos after event"" width=""1024"" height=""481"" />

Hosting an event after a major conference or expo is a great way to siphon all your most engaged attendees to show up for drinks, let loose, and talk it all out.

These are incredibly helpful happy hours and dinners, as all the attendees have just gotten back from your smash hit of a conference, and now they want to chat about it with others. This is a great opportunity to let the less-engaged or busier attendees to go home, while giving the dedicated attendees to really get to know each other.

These are the easiest things to do, and while they can fetch a price at venues, post-event happy hours can be an added-cost optional part of the event for non-VIPs to join, helping to edge against the cost. Either way the cost is worth it for the engagement had.

If attendees get out of the conference a great evening having felt they met the contacts they intended to meet, they’ll likely come back to your next event, or even bring their peers next time.
<h2>Back to you</h2>
Attendees are always seeking contacts. They may not say it abruptly, but it’s what a professional or industry conference is all about. We go there to empty our name cards out of our pockets, and to fill them with others’.

If your event cannot facilitate this level of networking, you may disappoint attendees and hurt your chances at having a better event next time. These strategies are here for you to explore, experiment with, mold to your liking, and hopefully succeed with.

Contact us if you need help getting your next event set up with the right tools in place. We’ll give you a demo of our event management software that has helped thousands of events around the globe.

Stella has almost single-handedly grown the American Chamber of Commerce Singapore’s branding efforts into the communication initiatives that drive AmCham’s marketing strategy today. Needless to say, having a visually cohesive communication strategy impacts AmCham Singapore’s members (and potential members) impression and engagement with the Chamber. Not only has Stella excelled in the marketing and branding of the Chamber, but she has also done so while integrating the needs of various departments, projects, and objectives of the organization.

To quantify Stella’s impact, AmCham’s social media followers have grown exponentially since she has taken the helm of the Chamber’s social media strategy; from a couple thousand followers across all three platforms (Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter), to almost 7,000 followers to date on LinkedIn alone. Most impressively, Stella’s drive and ambition to be self-taught have allowed her to create a unique role for herself within the Chamber.
<blockquote><em>“Stella’s willingness to take up new challenges and eagerness to learn new skills should be commended. She has a very bright future ahead of her.“</em>

As president of Australian - New Zealand Chamber of Commerce Philippines, Daniel championed the importance of Diversity and Inclusion (D&amp;I) in the workplace – this campaign has strongly echoed in all ANZCHAM events. Being the first chamber to promote this type of advocacy, a lot of member companies have started embracing D&amp;I in their respective workplaces by creating and implementing more inclusive programs and policies for their employees. Daniel overhauled and reassessed the objectives of the chamber, and professionalized the operations and services as soon as he was elected as the ANZCHAM president in 2018. One of his main thrusts was to reinforce the ANZCHAM’s commitment to diversity and create gender-balanced events and advocacies.

In terms of revenue, he drove ANZCHAM’s gains from a single-digit growth two years ago to 153% revenue growth in 2019 – the biggest increase in the last five years. Under his watch, he strengthened the objectives of the BPO Committee and pioneered the first Innovation Forum in 2017 where innovative measures in the Business Process Management (BPM) and IT sectors were introduced and featured. Since then, it became one of ANZCHAM’s most successful and signature events.
<blockquote><em>“Daniel led strong growth for the chamber and at the same time delivered innovative programmes that demonstrate a wider view of what a chamber can achieve such as their work in Diversity; a key driver for current Global business.“</em>

The gala was attended by over 300 AmCham members. The nominations showed diversity, both in industry and professional titles, and the range of nominees indicate the widespread impact of members in advancing women in leadership.

The intentions with this award were two-fold. First, is to highlight the achievements and contributions of members in advancing women in leadership. In addition to being recognized at the award ceremony to the 300+ attendees, AmCham broadcasted the HERo Awards winners throughout different social media channels. Second, looking forward, the agenda of the event is to inspire members, particularly senior management, to learn about the D&amp;I best practices of other AmCham member companies, and increase support and development of their own D&amp;I initiatives.

16765,"How to Implement Attendee Messaging at Your Events","Attendee-to-Attendee Chat is one of the fastest growing trends at events, particularly larger events where it’s just not possible to meet every person there. Attendee Chat is a major breakthrough, allowing everyone to chat with everyone else, but as one might imagine, this causes problems of their own.

It’s a Pandora's box of problems that need to be solved before you push your messaging service live.

Here’s how you should be implementing attendee chat at your next event.
<h2>Choosing the Right Messenger Platform</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16674 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/attendee-to-attendee-chat-eventbank@2x.png"" alt=""attendee messaging eventbank"" width=""1200"" height=""1352"" />

It’s important to choose the right event management or specific messaging platform to use. Unfortunately it’s not scalable to use consumer messaging apps because these messenger network you need to host should be specific to the event only.

This leaves you with a gap that needs to be filled by a specifically event-focused messaging platform that can keep all the attendees in the network only, and not to the public.

Some neat options are:
EventBank
Hollocrowd
EventMobi
Socio.events
Crowd Compass by Cvent
<a href=""http://Group.io"">Group.io</a>
Attendify

Each provider has their own packages, benefits, and pricing models, so choose one that helps your event style the most. We always suggest just going for event platform like us here at EventBank that has messaging inside already so all your data is in one place.
<h2>Choosing the Right Controls</h2>
Attendee Messaging is a Pandora's box. Once opened, if you’re not prepared beforehand, it can easily get out of hand, and then attendees could easily get annoyed with an overabundance of messages and requests.

Here’s a few controls put into place that can help you moderate the flow of chats during your event.
<h3>Limit Conversations</h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16672 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/value-copy-58@1x.png"" alt=""conference networking tips"" width=""1200"" height=""644"" />

Limiting the number of conversations an attendee can have at any given time is a great way to discourage over-messaging or spam from other attendees. It also has the added benefit of forcing attendees to choose carefully who they want to talk to, encouraging more meaningful conversations rather than just “more conversations”.

Some functions to watch out for would be to the ability to delete conversations to make room for new ones, this way attendees could prioritize their communication to other attendees.
<h3>Opt-Out</h3>
Give attendees the ability to opt-out of messaging. it’ll save headaches for those that just don’t want to partake. This may include refusing all messages incoming, or better, just not making that attendee discoverable by others on the messaging platform.

This is particularly useful since VIPs at events are large targets for attention.
<h3>Create Groups</h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16516 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eventbank-exploration-patterns-1-copy-dfsdsd-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-3@2x.png"" alt=""chambers and associations"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Creating groups is a smart way to get more like-minded attendees together and help draw people with common interests together. This should stir more meaningful conversations among each other rather than blasting messages into the event’s network and trying to discover your intended target audience.

A good function to look out for when it comes to groups, it whether or not being a part of a group has the ability to hide the attendee from other attendees outside of the group.

The idea here is that only attendees in a group of like minded individuals could actually earn unlimited messaging conversations at once so long as they're all part of the same group, as they could call engage in more engaging and topical discussions.
<h3>Allow Messaging Before &amp; After</h3>
Allow Messaging before and after your events to help drive buzz before and after the event’s conclusion. This also helps attendees who discovered people of interest but didn’t quite have a chance to exchange contact info to still have an opportunity to continue their discussions online.
<h3>Allot Staff to Moderate</h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16661 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/value-copy-20@2x.png"" alt=""chamber of commerce myths and misconceptions"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Sometimes you can’t always solve problems in real time like attendees getting harassed or abuse of the messaging platform, and with larger events with potentially thousands of attendees wanting a piece of the messaging service, it might be a good investment to have event staff monitor and moderate conversations and respond to reports by other attendees in real time.
<h2>Integrate Messaging to Social Media</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15571 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/value-copy-30@2x.png"" alt=""social media event branding"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

If the option is available, make sure whatever event management solution your using can implement attendee profiles to the platform, or even better, their social media profiles to the platform.

This should help with discovery on the messaging platform as attendees could then search keywords and find the most relevant attendee to strike up a conversation. Of course, with the above said controls in-mind.

By integrating social media though, you’re opening your event up to a more public platform, which can be extremely helpful as attendees no longer need to be asked to fill up their profile manually in your preferred event platform, only to simply allow LinkedIn for instance to access your platform.

However, don't make the mistake of using actual social media walls as your go-to feed. While inevitably it will garner discussion, some lessons were learned when Agile 2013 in Nashville, Tenesse had accidentally unleashed internet trolls into their public, un-moderated social media feed on twitter using their hashtag #agile2013, where trolls left racial and violent messages for attendees to see on screens throughout the event.

The anonymity of the internet leaves a lot of opportunity for those wrong-minded individuals to disrupt your events. By having a feed internally to the event and assigning each post to a very real, very present attendee on the floor, the attention is likely deterrent enough for anyone intent to disrupt the event.
<h2>Event Feeds and Content Walls</h2>
At arm’s length,event feeds are almost directly working together with messaging tools as they can help draw or drive the conversation. Any photos the attendees want to share, a quote, an experience can be shared onto a feed within your event platform that can be seen by all attendees, or it can be segregated into any particular groups that attendee might want to dictate their posts to.

This is a semi-recent trends where events hold open feeds for attendees to contribute to so that snapshots of experiences had at events won’t be missed and can be share by anyone. This also serves as a place to generate new discussion via messaging, engaging attendees in ways similar to their own social media feeds like LinkedIn, Twitter, and FaceBook.

There are other ways to implement messaging tools, and not all are the same. However no matter the implementation method used, it behoves event planners to properly moderate the conversation flow so that attendees don’t walk away annoyed. Otherwise, attendee messaging may just be the perfect engagement point for any conference in the future.

16776,"SaaS Startup EventBank Raises Series B to Boost Global Expansion Led by GSR Ventures","EventBank, an Event and Membership Management SaaS platform, announced Tuesday that it has raised its Series B funding in a bid to help boost the company’s continued global expansion in emerging and developing markets. GSR Ventures, a key investor of startup giants Didi and Ele.me, led the funding round.

EventBank’s rapid growth into emerging markets will help more organizations “go digital”, and with the new round of funding, the Company will continue R&amp;D investments that ensure customers will continue to bring their communities closer together. Following current trends, the MICE industry is expected to <strong>reach over $1,439.3 Billion by 2025</strong> thanks to event-tech.

Allen Zhu, Managing Director of GSR Ventures, will also join the board of EventBank.

Founded in 2013, Eric L. Schmidt and Olivia Jingshu Ji created EventBank out of the frustration that many event and organization managers face when dealing with events and campaigns where data is often siloed and easily corrupted, lost, or confusing. The core product, the EventBank platform, combines a CRM with event management, membership management, email marketing, mobile apps, and more, into an all-in-one cloud platform that consolidates data and improves engagement.

Schmidt says, “<em>EventBank has learned a lot working with our customers across the world to have a product that is easy to use and deploy. Beyond North America, EventBank has a unique understanding, in-depth insights, and operational capabilities in the markets of Asia Pacific, China, Africa, Russia, etc., where there is a big opportunity to digitize events and entire organizations.</em>”

EventBank’s winning formula has made an impact in the APAC region, where phases of the product have rolled out early in the company’s history and continuously improved upon over time. In the past 3 years, EventBank has expanded operations across the globe. The company is also opening a new office in India later this month. Facebook, Daimler and KPMG are clients of EventBank, and other multinational brands are eager to see the platform come to their markets with increased localized support.

Zhu says that, “<em>EventBank has elite international teams across it's organization. Therefore, many international enterprises become its paid clients so rapidly within just one year after its entering new markets. It's quite smart for EventBank to put the Event Marketing Cloud and Membership Management Cloud as its entry point. The four advantages are clear; international teams, innovative products, high-quality global clients, and the integration between SaaS and payments under different scenarios. EventBank is one of the few startup companies that has the qualification to be successful in global markets. I am confident that EventBank can become an influential unicorn in the SaaS industry.</em>""

Olivia comments that, “<em>We are very appreciative for this round of funding led by GSR Ventures. With the rapid increase of clients, we still need to continue to put a lot of effort into product innovation, customer success and other areas of our operations, with the goal of striving to provide our clients with the best product.</em>""

The new injection also is a bid to expand regional EventBank offices and upgrade them from sales offices to full support teams for their respective markets including customer success staff, local currency payment processing, and other services.

<h2>Personal QR Code for Check-Ins</h2>
[caption id=""attachment_628"" align=""alignnone"" width=""984""]<img class=""wp-image-628 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Check-Ins.jpg"" alt=""Event Registration Tips"" width=""984"" height=""406"" /> Make sure that your event runs smoothly[/caption]

Traditionally, check-in desks at events have a pen &amp; paper style of double checking if you’re registered, checking off your name, and letting you in. While it’s simply said, it’s not exactly simple in practice when these little questionnaires can add up tens of minutes to the wait time to get into the event. This also doesn’t account for non-registered attendees, or even people falsifying who they are.

Check-ins and new-attendee registration is made often easier by the use of PCs at the desk that take in QR codes scanned by arriving attendees that they received when they registered online before arriving at the event. With the addition of an app however, you can check in attendees via QR codes by scanning them with your phone’s event management tool, and then letting them in. This reduces the friction of check ins and ensures a smooth and secure check in process.
<h2>Push Notiﬁcations</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-264 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/WeChat-Image_20170519173431-577x1024.jpg"" alt=""Push notifications and other subscriptions to inform about event"" width=""577"" height=""1024"" />

Push notifications are also a handy option to have when you’re on the go and you need to deliver an important message that has a more guaranteed read-rate. Push notifications allow you to deliver a message directly to member’s or contact’s phones with a higher degree of open-rates than email. This is super handy when you’re on the go and you just can’t simply wait for a PC to send an email campaign, or if the message is urgent.
<h2>Event Information Always at Hand</h2>
<img class=""alignnone wp-image-1526 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/platform-hero@2x.png"" alt=""All-in one app, event ROI"" width=""2180"" height=""1912"" />

Analytics are the bread and butter of any industry now days. No matter what you do, you’re doing it by the numbers, even if you aren’t aware of it. You could be caught in a meeting, ran into a savvy investor at a party, or that guy in high school you really want to 1-up. Well, with an app dedicated to managing your organization or events, all this data is collected, including all your check in processes, website registrations, email campaign results, and more. This helps you seem less unprepared, and you can whip out your analytics whenever you need it or you just have the itch.
<h2>Session Documents &amp; Presentations</h2>
<img class=""alignnone wp-image-1529 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/event-screenshot-mockup-2018-flat@0.5x-e1529913396457.png"" alt=""professional template, event ROI"" width=""751"" height=""555"" />

An app’s easiest feature and something that is helpful in a pinch, is the ability to see presentations and documents should your organization run any webinars or promise to deliver decks to audiences if they attended an event. Nothing flashy here, it’s just helpful to view and share documents on the go without needing to access your remote servers or cloud storage.
<h2>Attendee-to-Attendee Messaging</h2>
<img class=""alignnone wp-image-16674 size-large"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/attendee-to-attendee-chat-eventbank@2x-909x1024.png"" alt=""attendee messaging eventbank"" width=""909"" height=""1024"" />

Attendee-to-Attendee Messaging is one of the most in-demand features for events these days, particularly for any larger events or conferences with more than a few hundred people who can’t possibly meet one another during the span of the event. To help facilitate better networking at big events, it can be easier to just have attendees download your app’s front-end and use it to find and chat with other attendees. There’s some cons to this, but we go over it in more detail in our article here.
<h2>Newsletters &amp; Campaigns</h2>
<img class=""alignnone wp-image-3292 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Email-Campaigns-Ad-Copy@2x.png"" alt=""event email marketing guide"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Newsletters and Email campaigns are also major way to promote events, share news, and deliver any other marketing materials and content you wish to your audience. Having these things be visible and available on the go is super helpful when you know you have your team working on content and you need to keep tabs on the content or the performance of any emails sent out. This works by letting you preview emails or using the analytics feature to find out
<h2>Live Event Wall</h2>
<img class=""alignnone wp-image-15369 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/会员粘性.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1920"" height=""1059"" />

Live event walls, or otherwise known as event social feeds, are a great way to let attendees to post live updates about their experiences at your event. These walls exist either publicly using hashtags, or more recently, with event-specific apps that attendees use to see what’s going on from other attendee’s perspectives. This is a great front-end experience for attendees and it gives your events new life as you let other attendees create content for you.
<h2>Business Card Exchange</h2>
<img class=""alignnone wp-image-1528 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/check-in-2-phones.jpg"" alt=""mobile check-in, event ROI"" width=""1620"" height=""1080"" />

Another great front-end feature for attendees or members is that you can use the app to scan QR codes not just for checking in at events, but also to identify yourself via a virtual membership card or business card. This helps make it easier for people to make connections that can’t get lost in someone’s Rolodex somewhere, and it’s overall a much stronger way for people to network since now it removes a lot of awkwardness should you be left without your business cards one day and catch yourself meeting someone you really need to connect with.
<h2>Going Forward</h2>
Taking on a mobile app is more than just installing it on your phone and going about your business. There’s got to be some level of on-boarding, data transfer, and event some training to help you understand how it all works and connect it to whatever tools your organization is using. It’s a bigger investment that what it seems like on the surface, but as long as you can organize your audience or members to adopt the app prior to events or at membership sign up, the app’s adoption will feed into your organization’s growth.

16812,"Success Story: Why Inland Empire Chamber Switched to EventBank from Chamber Master","This success story is a result of feedback received from the <a href=""https://www.iechamber.org/"">Inland Empire Regional Chamber of Commerce</a> (IERCC) in the United States where a solution was needed to replace their previous chamber management software, Chamber Master. The IERCC was seeking at the time a replacement that could harmonize all of their needed tools under one roof, while simplifying the back-end experience so that they could focus on bringing engaging experiences to their members.
<h2>The Old School</h2>
The Inland Empire Regional Chamber of Commerce had been using Chamber Master prior to their 2017 sign on date with EventBank, and through their rough experience using Chamber Master, they grew to loathe it as it simply was not being updated to meet with standard digital b2b platforms. Chamber Master was reportedly too “old school”, and the backend was confusing enough that it made it more of a headache to use over time.

The Inland Regional Chamber was in need of a platform that had all of their necessary features and tools under one umbrella, that was easy to use, and smarter than the average digital platform on the market.
<h2>The New School</h2>
After searching for some time, the IERCC came across EventBank among other tools, and saw early on that EventBank not only had the required tool-sets and feature-sets, but these tools all communicated with each other, consolidating data into one place, and removing unnecessary work that Chamber Master fostered.

After a smooth on-boarding and data-migration from Chamber Master to EventBank, the IERCC was pleased with the smooth transition, citing that EventBank was just a smarter platform overall, simple to use, and the customer success support could not have been better.

</div>
<blockquote><em>“It is imperative that you research Eventbank if you want to take your chamber to the next level. As with any new software application there will be be a learning curve, but once you familiarize yourself with Eventbank, you'll love it! It's the best software on the market for any business organization, not just chambers of commerce.” </em>
<h6><strong>Edward Ornelas, Jr.,</strong> Inland Empire Chamber of Commerce, President</h6>
</blockquote>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>The Results</h2>
Since 2017, the IERCC has been spending a lot less time fidgeting with their software, and are now using it to engage members in a much smarter manner. With the prioritization of work dedicated to content, engagement, and deliverable messaging, the IERCC was spending their time more wisely on EventBank, rather than solving headaches with Chamber Master before.

Each tool with Chamber Master fit the IERCC’s needs, but because of the convoluted back-end experience and lack of consolidated data, Inland Regional Chamber had found that most of their experience on Chamber Master was solving issues caused by Chamber Master like mis-allocated data, duplicate data, and tools that simply could not have the same content replicated in other tools.

An example of EventBank’s smarter use of data between tools is the ability to create event web pages with your content, and with only a few clicks and less than 2 minutes, you could generate event invite emails using your content, images, and settings without any manual labor added to the process, saving time and effort in the promotional stages of events.

Since then the IERCC has been an avid supporter of EventBank, and is one of our most active clients, giving feedback to our customer support teams so that we can improve experiences for all of our clients.
<h3>About the Inland Empire Regional Chamber of Commerce</h3>

16877,"7 Tips When Hosting Webinars & Virtual Events","Ever since the explosive spread of the COVID 19 (Coronavirus) virus, practically the whole working world has been working from their homes and transforming their work so that it can rely solely on digital engagement both internally and externally. That means <strong>more </strong>conference calls, <strong>more </strong>video chats, <strong>more </strong>online demos, and of course, transforming events so that they’re hosted online in webinars.

Here’s some tips to take home with you when you start planning your next event for an entirely online audience even if you’re doing it from home.

[su_youtube url=""https://youtu.be/htNynzN74kU""]
<h2 id=""clear"">1. Clear your office or home of clutter</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15919 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/value-copy-30@2x.png"" alt=""how to find event speakers"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Whether the hosting of the event is going to take place at your office or from your home, just make sure you tidy up a bit. It’ll help keep you organized while taking on other steps in the setup process, but not only that, in case your webinar ends up using video, you’ll be showing your more professional side through a neat and tidy workspace.

This also means minimizing what audiences see through the camera, which means clearing your background and removing anything distracting. A trophy, for instance, maybe entirely professional looking in your office or home, but it <strong>may actually distract audiences</strong> from listening to you if you actually have interesting things in the background. So, keeping it a little bit boring might actually be helpful for your webinar to keep the focus on the speaker.

Also, this goes without saying, make sure the background doesn’t give away any personal information of yourself or others. This includes making the room far away from any work calls happening so no one on the webinar can eavesdrop, an unfortunate mistake we have seen before plenty of times.
<h2 id=""family"">2. Keep co-workers or family busy/silent</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16516 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eventbank-exploration-patterns-1-copy-dfsdsd-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-3@2x.png"" alt=""chambers and associations"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Nothing is more disturbing to a webinar if someone comes in to disrupt it. If you have your own office, home office, or other private space to work from, put up a clear sign outside the door saying Do No Disturb. If you’re out of an office, a nice big friendly CC Reminder will help, as well as even locking the door (but follow fire code please).

If you’re at home, we both know a sign doesn't mean much to a nosy spouse or 6-year-old, so you may actually need to find a creative way to keep them occupied. Sending them out on a mission to get something you know will have trouble finding, or otherwise sending them off to do their favorite activity will be certainly good at keeping them out of the house.

What if there’s say, a huge pandemic impacting the world and you can’t just leave the home? Tricky, but you can keep them busy with TV, a board game, anything that stops them from getting bored and barging into your webinar.
<h2 id=""upgrade"">3. Get better A/V equipment</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16470 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eventbank-exploration-patterns-1-copy-dfsdsd-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-2@2x-2.png"" alt=""marketing trends in 2020"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

These days it’s getting easier for folks to attend webinars with more readily available computer and mobile devices, including headphones, microphones, and more. Even more so, it’s getting even easier to save recordings of webinars to be shared later. That means Webinars are becoming more permanent, rather than one-time events, meaning that you can now share past webinars.

The flip side of this is that your focus on quality Audio and Video is even more important than before. Higher quality recordings will generally have better longevity online. Video can sometimes be left not invested in unless your current video quality is below 720p native resolution. You can test this by simply recording a quick test clip and right-clicking the file in your PC and viewing the “properties” and finding the resolution there.

Audio, however, is one of the most important aspects of a webinar, especially if it’s not going to include a lot of visual guides. For this, some suggested equipment for microphones would be the <a href=""https://www.walmart.com/ip/Blue-Microphones-Yeti-Microphone-Stereo-20-Hz-to-20-kHz-Wired-Electret-Condenser-Cardioid-Bi-directional-Omni-directional-Desktop-USB/123889695"">Blue Yeti</a>, <a href=""https://www.walmart.com/ip/Blue-Snowball-iCE-Condenser-Microphone-Cardioid-White-1974/23142968"">Blue Yeti Snowball</a>, <a href=""https://www.walmart.com/ip/Shure-Cardioid-Dynamic-Vocal-Microphone-SM58-LC/10747534?irgwc=1&amp;sourceid=imp_xOXTEw35CxyOUwXwUx0Mo3Q1Uki0w2ygXQBqUg0&amp;veh=aff&amp;wmlspartner=imp_1442478&amp;clickid=xOXTEw35CxyOUwXwUx0Mo3Q1Uki0w2ygXQBqUg0"">Shure SM58</a>, or the <a href=""https://www.walmart.com/ip/Razer-Seiren-X-Supercardioid-Pick-Up-Pattern-Condenser-Mic-Built-In-Shock-Mount-Professional-Grade-Streaming-Microphone/257892987"">Razer Siren X</a>. There might be other fitting microphones in this price range, but generally, these microphones are high enough quality for recording.

Don’t worry too much about your voice coming through in the live webinar as compression through the web and your streaming platform will likely reduce quality no matter how good your microphone is. The raw recording, however, will have a major improvement.
<h2 id=""webinar"">4. Find a fitting webinar platform</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16661 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/value-copy-20@2x.png"" alt=""chamber of commerce myths and misconceptions"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

While you may be used to having demos or internal conference calls over some platforms like Slack, Microsoft Teams, Google Hangouts, Skype, or even Discord, the free versions usually are only for internal users at your workplace, or simply limit the number of concurrent users in a call.

This is where tools like <a href=""https://www.gotomeeting.com/en-hk/webinar"">GoToWebinar</a>, <a href=""https://zoom.us/"">Zoom</a>, and other webinar platforms play an important role. They excel in having a very large audience-single speaker style of video conferencing. Perfect for a webinar.

Each tool has a separate way of packaging their offers, as well as what admin tools you’ll have available to you. This is where it’ll take some shopping and product comparisons to determine what’s best for your webinar’s structure. If you intend to have the audience get involved, which can be effective and is a bigger trend these days, then tools with strong admin abilities would be favored in order to control the audio.
<h2 id=""audience"">5. Get the audience involved</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16809 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/eventbank-blog-mobile@2x.png"" alt=""audience engagement"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

As we eluded to earlier, it’s not required, but it’s a big trend that webinars are including the audience as a part of the webinar. It’s engaging and makes the audience feel they’re getting their time’s worth.

There’s also some advantage to having the audience engage with the speaker. In a physical room, people can be overshadowed by louder individuals, those in the back of the room may get fewer chances to be seen, or simply the speaker could miss a raised hand.

By being online, a webinar gives equal footing for all attendees, and with good admin controls, it can be easy to give people a more fair chance to speak. This also makes them more clear for all attendees, as well as keeping people more snappy with responses, no need to pass mics around the room or quiet down the audience when you can simply blanket-mute a room.

Overall, audiences love asking questions, giving opinions, sharing experiences, and challenging the speaker. Again, it’s up to you to let the audience get involved, it may be that audience involvement harms your format, but it’s something to consider even if it’s a quick Q&amp;A after the call.
<h2 id=""dryrun"">6. Do a dry run (or two)</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16527 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eventbank-exploration-patterns-1-copy-dfsdsd-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-5@2x.png"" alt=""event management skills"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Dry run the webinar. Get friends and colleagues to join and help test your A/V equipment. Make sure recordings come out just fine, and get them to practice engaging with you on the audience’s end to help you with the admin controls.

If things can get too much for you, try including helpers to host the webinars, admins to control the audience, and other menial admin tasks so that you’re not handling it all live. Trust us, it can be a bit much to do all these at once while speaking to an audience.

Dry runs are also a great way to test other features like email campaigns that invite or follow up the event.
<h2 id=""followup"">7. Post-webinar follow-up</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16810 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/eventbank-blog-phone@2x.png"" alt=""mobile notifications"" width=""2400"" height=""1288"" />

Webinars need to bring value to the table. Most webinars come off as educational seminars or informative speaking opportunities, but if you the company or organization are hosting a webinar, then you really need to siphon as much value from the audience as possible without taking their experience away.

Post-event follow up is as important for webinars as it is for physical events. Whether it’s a survey to gauge the audience’s experience, or a follow up with a discount for those that attended the webinar in order to entice a sale, post-webinar follow-ups are your chance to get one last sweeping engagement point to your audience. They’ve already attended your event, so you can assume the responses will be quite genuine and fruitful. Don’t miss this opportunity. Check out our article that can go into more depth about your <a href=""http://blog.eventbank.com/event-planning-guide/"">event engagement process</a>.
<h2>Back to you</h2>
Now that we’ve armed you with the best tips in the industry, it’s time for you to put them into practice. Webinars have seen even more importance in the world since the COVID 19 outbreak, and even after the pandemic is over, it’s very likely that businesses will use online events as proper engagement points as they discover their benefits over physical events.

16924,"5 Kinds of Events that Fit Perfectly as Webinars","With the recent global quarantining procedures affecting daily life for many office workers, the value of webinars, video conferences, online demos, and so on, has <strong>increased</strong> quite a bit.

Businesses who may not have used virtual means of doing business in earnest are now discovering not just their value during a global work-at-home situation, but it’s highly likely that this event will leave virtual meetings to be even more in-demand once the situation settles down.

With this in mind, it’s important to find out what events should fit such a new medium of business communication, and surprisingly, they’re quite similar to in-person events you might already be hosting. Let’s dig in.

&nbsp;
<blockquote>Check out our latest platform update that helps give ROI back to your webinars.

[su_youtube url=""https://youtu.be/htNynzN74kU""]</blockquote>
<h2>Workshops</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16516 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/eventbank-exploration-patterns-1-copy-dfsdsd-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-3@2x.png"" alt=""chambers and associations"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Workshops, courses, academies, and training sessions you would normally have held in-person are one of the easiest events to translate onto the digital world. Entire universities offer courses that are entirely online, and it’s really not that hard to do it yourself for your business purposes.

But what if you never held any sort of coursework before? If you haven’t noticed, it’s actually becoming more and more popular for businesses to offer free courses, certifications for their products, and other training sessions that can cover a wide range of products and services.

It’s a great way to generate leads, engage your network, and share knowledge that can help them.

As workshops and courses go, university systems were the first early adopters of this technology, and you can even find entire accredited universities that are completely online. No physical classrooms or in-person meetings.

This has become even more in-demand as far as other examinations go, including certificates so that you can become certified in other tools, products, and services through online work.

Your own business can easily offer something similar by identifying a piece of knowledge you want to share and teach to others that are related to your offerings. A webinar is the perfect medium for classes as it can be offered privates but to scalable audiences as well as be recorded for future classes or for review.
<h2>Interviews</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16771 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/eventbank-blog@2x.png"" alt=""audience engagement with eventbank"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Interviews can be done live with industry leaders or influencers that should help out while everyone is back home. In fact, live streaming and media streaming skyrocketed during the coronavirus quarantined areas in the US.

People working from home are looking for entertainment more than ever, and an interview with someone popular may just be the thing that puts attention on your brand.

Simply set up a webinar with a lot of pre-promotion, and have your guest dial into the call for an interview.

Obviously, a real in-person interview level of care will still be needed for a webinar version, so make sure your questions are well informed and relevant to the speaker and the topic of discussion.
<h2>Panels</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16882 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/eventbank-blog-COVID@2x.png"" alt=""webinar tips"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Like interviews, panel discussions are easy enough to host as webinars, this would need some cues from the host, and so we recommend that there be a webcam for each speaker so the small visual cues they can give will aide in the flow of the conversations. Small gestures and hand movements can help “pass the mic”.

If this isn’t enough for a chatty group, depending on the type of webinar host you use, you could even force-mute other speakers in a quasi “virtual gavel banging” to help other speakers get a chance to speak up.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16672 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/value-copy-58@1x.png"" alt=""conference networking tips"" width=""1200"" height=""644"" />

AMAs, otherwise known as Ask Me Anything, are basically a Q&amp;A event, which may not be a typical in-person event, but they’re quite a new online-only event that was started via Reddit threads where people of notable, popular, interesting, or niche positions or experiences lead a thread of public Q&amp;As.

This can be developed for businesses that are now working mostly online these days.

This means either finding someone within or outside of your organization who would be an interesting individual for your audience.

Almost like an Interview, an Ask Me Anything topic gets the audience involved. Instead of a host asking questions, a webinar version of AMAs would ideally have the audience members chime into the call with questions of their own for the speaker.

Again this will require some administration from the webinar platform, but if done correctly, it can create a very engaging event and it lets your audience get involved, so it’ll likely stick out to them compared to other competing webinars that are swamping inboxes these days.
<h2>Office Hours</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15919 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/value-copy-30@2x.png"" alt=""how to find event speakers"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Office Hours are a strictly in-person, and someone school-oriented, ‘events’. But the reality is that this a great time to get some one-on-one time with customers. Now that you’re working from home, why not create a public webinar where single users can call into you for a quick chit chat.

“Office Hours” for you could be a link to your webinar where only one attendee can come in at a time and it lets them speak freely with a company or organization’s leadership to speak freely and ask questions.

While not public, these events are something that can be personal, intimate, and accessible. Since you’re at home, it’s unlikely you’ll need to run around an office, and so taking the time to let customers or members dial-in can leave a lot more transparency to your organization during times of distancing from each other.
<h2>Take the reigns</h2>
There are probably other events that fit in a webinar format, and if you’re comfortable with physical events that you’re used to, try to explore how those can be translated into webinars that are engaging and use some technical help to make it actually even more scalable.

Maybe your events sell out, where now you can handle any number of attendees. Maybe you have problems with speakers joining for logistical reasons who can now guarantee to join since they’re always going to be at home now on. There’s a lot of opportunity lying in wait during social distancing, and it’s up to you how to best make sure of everyone new time found at home.

16960,"6 Ways to Attract Young Professionals to Your Chamber","“Young people are the future“ is a fact that cannot be ignored. Whether we’re talking about your chamber or society as a whole, young people have a huge say in which way the future goes. It isn’t reasonable to believe that your chamber will survive without the next, younger generation in line to run it.

You don’t want to alienate potential younger members from joining your chamber. With this in mind, here’s 6 tips on how to attract young people to your chamber and keep them there.
<blockquote>Check out our latest platform update that helps with your community management needs.

[su_youtube url=""https://youtu.be/htNynzN74kU""]</blockquote>
<h2>Invite Them</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16810 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/eventbank-blog-phone@2x.png"" alt=""mobile notifications"" width=""2400"" height=""1288"" />

Don’t underestimate the power of an invitation. Although it might seem like an antiquated idea that doesn’t align with the newness and innovation that young people crave, nothing is more direct than an invitation.

Inviting young people to join your organization not only helps you target this group in a direct way, but it makes them feel like wanted and valuable members of your association.

Along with this, try to invite younger speakers to your events. Also try to host events that suit younger member’s interests, meaning topics related to upcoming industries like technology, software, media, and more.

These tips can help your chamber connect with a younger audience and potentially boost engagement. This engagement can lead to your young chamber members referring their friends, helping you grow your membership and in particular, your young members.

Overall, simply reaching out to young people can be very effective in achieving your chamber’s goals. Don’t overthink your strategy. Sometimes the most simple solution can be the best. Simple solutions also have the characteristic of extending past generational gaps, so if you want someone to join your chamber, regardless of their age, don’t be afraid to just ask!
<h2>Create a personalized experience</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16951 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/eventbank-webinars@2x.png"" alt=""online meetings"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Young people prefer products that offer something that is or feels like a personalized experience. Because of this, we can see a trend in what businesses offer people. For example, Netflix creates curated suggestions for users to watch next based on what they watched previously.

Amazon recommends products they believe you’d like based on what you’ve purchased in the past or what you’ve been searching. This tactic doesn’t only create a personalized experience, but it ensures that members keep coming back for more. But creating a personalized experience doesn’t only apply to streaming services or retail. You and your chamber can also take advantage of this phenomenon.

Don’t offer overly generic experiences to your members, especially your young members. Show that you have knowledge of your young member’s careers or interests. You can gather this information through surveys or by just asking.

Once you gather this knowledge, you can organize events that cater to what your young members may be interested in. Do they want help finding jobs? Do they want mentors to help them with their careers?

As topics such as these are often appreciated by younger people, you can set up these types of events that are sure to attract young people to your chamber. Along with this, try to have young people make decisions alongside the already existing leadership within your chamber.

They can help you determine what young people would like to see from your chamber. Young members would also have someone to relate to within chamber leadership.
<h2>Offer classes</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15108 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/eventbank-exploration-patterns-1-copy-13@2x.png"" alt=""event data collection"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Today’s job market calls for more and more educational requirements.

Considering that many young people are new to or have yet to enter the workforce, it only makes sense that a lot of people searching for educational opportunities relating to work would be young.

Some these skills also cannot necessarily be taught in classrooms. According to <a href=""https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/recovery-job-growth-and-education-requirements-through-2020/"">Georgetown University</a>, employers seek cognitive skills such as communication and analytics, skills that are often best learned outside of a classroom setting. Capitalizing on young professionals’ need for education can help you attract young members to your chamber.

In order to draw in more young professionals to your chamber, consider holding certified classes and workshops targeted towards young professionals. These courses should be relevant to what young people need to succeed in the job market. Possibly try to focus classes on new technologies that more and more jobs want employees knowing.

It can also be helpful for young people to hold workshops relating to innovation and creativity since these skills are highly valued in today’s job market. Young professionals may not also have the same economic resources as your older chamber members, so try making these classes and workshops more affordable.

Holding classes that align with the interests of young professionals have the potential to draw them to your chamber and eventually, to holding chamber membership.
<h2>Use Social Media</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-15571 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/value-copy-30@2x.png"" alt=""social media event branding"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

Being up-to-date with current technology can help your chamber grow. If you’re still using pamphlets and newspaper advertisements to reach out to more potential members, you’re almost guaranteed to not gain any young members to your chamber.

Such ways of advertising are quite antiquated in today’s digital society. Social media allows you to connect with so many new people. This is part of the appeal that draws in so many young people to use social media as often as they do. You are also able to keep up with people and celebrities without having to personally know them or having to pay for a magazine.

With such convenient technologies at everyone’s fingertips, why would people revert to checking the newspaper for your ads or take extra time to request a pamphlet. If you aren’t already, consider making the switch to digital media and in particular, social media. The benefits it can have on your chamber could be tremendous.

When making decisions, many young people like to do their research on the internet. Making the decision to join your chamber is no different. Some popular platforms for young people to use are Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.

So if your chamber doesn’t already have these accounts, it may be a good idea to create one on at least one of these sites. Make sure your social media presence is also up-to-date. This refers both to the actual information on your social media as well as being able to create posts regularly.

Just having social media accounts is not enough to convince young people to join your chamber. Post regularly, especially when you have events that would appeal to a younger audience. Doing so can help you stay relevant in a digital age.
<h2>Team up with local colleges</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-16138 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/value-copy-60@2x-1.png"" alt=""education"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

As a chamber of commerce, you bring businesses together, advocate on their behalf, and support them. In other words, you have a lot of business-related resources at your disposal. If any demographic of people want to know more about business and make more connections, it’s people that are in college.

Young people still want and need to learn more about the business world, especially outside of the context of the classroom. Many times they also want to expand their networks since they may not have one to begin with. Take advantage of what you’re best at and market it to potential younger members.

You should consider taking your chamber to local colleges. You can possibly get in contact with colleges’ career centers and see if they would be willing to talk about your organization or post advertisements or pamphlets in their offices. As many students often use these offices as resources, it’s possible that your chamber can catch their eye!

Also, see if you can potentially join or contribute to colleges’ job fairs. You can offer to help colleges bring businesses to their schools. Your chamber can have its own booth at the fair, where you can tell students of the benefits of joining the chamber.

If you have internships or jobs to offer, try giving your local college students a chance. Their ideas and connections can help you make the changes needed to attract even more young people to your chamber of commerce!
<h2>Targeted Marketing</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3292 size-full"" src=""http://blog.eventbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Email-Campaigns-Ad-Copy@2x.png"" alt=""event email marketing guide"" width=""1920"" height=""1030"" />

How are you marketing your chamber? Is generic information that would appeal to everyone still gracing your flyers or website’s front page? While generic information is not necessarily a bad thing, it can prevent you from reaching your target audience.

Sometimes what appeals to the masses may not appeal to young professionals in particular. Consider switching up your marketing in order to attract younger people to your chamber.

Appealing to those you want to join your chamber is rooted in the same logic as inviting them. If you want them to join, make it obvious! This can be done by emphasizing how your chamber can help them succeed in the workplace. Once again, advertise your events that are put in place to benefit young people.

Show them the value your chamber has in regard to expanding networks. Make sure that pictures of young professionals interacting with your chamber are front-and-center of your marketing efforts. Make yourself look relatable! These changes towards more targeted marketing can make a huge difference in the demographics of your chamber.

Hopefully, after reading these tips, you now have an idea of how to attract young members to your chamber. Try these ideas out and bring some fresh young faces to your chamber!
