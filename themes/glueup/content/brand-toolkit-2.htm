<p class="">In 2013, we started EventBank with the idea of being able to connect businesses and their communities globally to increase their economic opportunities through the use of our technology. Over the years, we kept adding more features to EventBank and our platform became more than “just” event managment software. The company grew up and our software evolved to an all-in-one engagement platform offering so much more than what our old name EventBank would suggest.</p>

<p class="">To ensure you and your communities have all the information about this important change, we have prepared this document which is divided into four sections for easy navigation:</p>
