<p>Glue Up, previously EventBank, was founded in 2013, started with the idea on how to bridge the gap that event organizers had in managing events with technology. <br>Two years later, weâ€™ve built membership management tools and a few years later, EventBank was more than just "events". </p>
<p>The brand grew up to become an all-in-one engagement platform.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2020, Glue Up expanded its portfolio to bring communities and engagement to the center of attention, making clients' success our mission.</p> <p>Today, Glue Up empowers organisations, revolutionizing relationships, delivering long-term business value, and making modern engagement more purposeful.</p>
