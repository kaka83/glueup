<h4 id="item-1">What changes for us?</h4>

<h5 id="item-1-1">A new brand </h5>

<p>Counting from August 24th we will deploy a new domain for our platform, and update our branding on the platform. Our sender address for system emails will be sent out from no-reply@eventbank.com</p>


<h5 id="item-1-2">Glue Up logo </h5>

<p>The logo will be updated on the platform and our mobile apps. Our system emails will also include our new Glue Up logo.

<h5 id="item-1-3">My Glue </h5>

<p>We have updated your personal page (formerly My EventBank) where you can manage your personal Settings and Preferences and particularly find the activities and informations enabled for the organizations you follow. Discover it here (https://www.glueup.com/my/home/).</p>


<h4 id="item-2" class="py-5">What changes for you as a client (organization account)</h4>

<h5 id="item-2-1">How will this affect your organization? </h5>

<p>All event pages, campaigns, and other links will be automatically redirected to the new corresponding page in the new domain to ensure there is no disruption in the service. If users try to access the service using former EventBank links, they will be redirected to the new page on Glue Up instead.</p>

<p>Only if you are currently using our API, you will have to take action (check below point).</p>


<h5 id="item-2-2">Update your API - take action!</h5>

<p>If you have integrated certain parts of our platform with your website via EventBank API, make sure to update your endpoints from EventBank to Glue Up (the page will be redirecting to the corresponding server on .COM / .CN / .RU). Make sure to update your end-points by November 24, 2020, as the temporary redirection of end-points will be discontinued after that date.</p>

<p>Find here the Glue Up API documentation (https://glueupapi.docs.apiary.io/). Please reach out to support@glueup.com or support@eventbank.com if you require any further assistance.</p>

<h5 id="item-2-3">What happens with my published events?</h5>

<p>Your visitors will automatically be redirected to the corresponding page on Glue Up. If you prefer, you may update the links, but this is not a mandatory step.</p>
<h5 id="item-2-5">What happens if I have integrated other apps such as Xero, Quickbooks, Zoom, or Google Analytics?</h5>
<p>If you are using any of the integrations on EventBank, these will not require to be updated, you can continue utilizing them without amending the setup.</p>
<h5 id="item-2-6">What if I am using an EventBank sender domain? (i.e. info@companyname.eventbankmail.com)</h5>
