<h5 id="item-1-1">A new brand </h5>
<img src="{{ 'glueup-community-feature.svg' | media }}" class="paygage-visual py-2" style="max-height: 300px; width: auto;" alt="logo">
<p>EventBank is now Glue Up! EventBank has been transforming professional communities through digital solutions focusing on automation and engagement since 2013. The new name <span style="color:#001C6C;">Glue Up</span> represents the strength of our solutions, our growth, and our commitment to bring communities and engagement to the center of attention, making your success our mission.</p>

<p>Today, our platform empowers organizations in more than 50 countries worldwide, revolutionizing relationships, delivering long-term business value, and making modern engagement more purposeful.</p>

<p>With an intuitive SaaS platform, we are the leading provider of the cloud solutions that provide associations, event organizers, Chambers of Commerce, agencies, marketers, businesses, and NGOs with a full suite of tools designed to streamline operations, modernize processes, and eliminate engagement challenges.</p>





<h5 id="item-1-2" class="pt-5">Our new Glue Up logo  </h5>
<img src="{{ 'assets/images/glueup-logo-en.svg' | theme }}" class="paygage-visual py-5 px-5" style="max-height: 300px; width: auto;" alt="logo">
<p>Our new logo is bolder, simpler, and better structured. It is composed of three dots, two of them interconnected. It represents the relationship between our software, the organizations we work with and their communities.</p>

<p>We want to convey the importance of that relationship between organizations (our customers) and their members as that is the main mission of Glue Up.</p>

<p>Our new color scheme brings a strength and clarity to our communication, making it easier to read and understand for everyone.</p>

<p>Our new font is Ubuntu. It is bold, simple, and universal. Just like our Glue Up platform. We have decided for Ubuntu - an open source fontset that meets all these criteria and further emphasizes our focus on communities and open society.</p>

<p>The new logo will be updated on the platform and in our mobile apps. Our system emails will also include our new Glue Up logo. Download web-friendly versions of our logo in black, white, and color in multiple formats and learn more about how to use our logos in our new branding guidelines.</p>
